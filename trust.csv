"I did NOT purchase any of the self-driving/driver assist features on my current vehicle because they are first-generation technology; hacking into cars is a recent phenomenon, so I would wait for second or third generation systems."


Just with the way that a person or persons could access your vehicle and control your vehicle.  First it would have to be so secured that NO unauthorized person (s)  could access the vehicle.  Truly concerned with this technology.


Can make cars to complicated and that will distract the driver.

"They should be able to do what they are supposed to and if not, large lawsuits would arrise"
Havent had an issue to make me concerned

It probably would be a great innovative feature but would be a great concern on that advanced technology and how far out it would be to assume a car can drive itself

"hacking, their are so many people trying to prrof they can hack anything and everything.  i do not need my insurance to skyrocket if this would happen."


just adds more money to cost



I believe the technologies would be well tested


"1)  I am perfectly capable of doing my own driving. 2)  I am sick to DEATH of ""smart"" technology. 3)  Needless expense."



a driver needs to be in control of things themselves.
"Having a self driven car is a little scary as others can take control of it, or if it malfunctions i am at its mercy"



worried about being hacked
i am not concerned

too distracting and promotes dependence

Computers make mistakes just like a humans do and I would not put my life or the life of my friends or loved ones in the hands of technology or a inhuman object.

"Sort of like how banks and retailers can't guarantee safety of information, I don't think cars can"

it takes away our privacy and could allow others access to every aspect of our lives

Pricey
Dont know how secure my info would be
People are always trying to see if the can hack into new technology.  So it's  just a manner of time when they will hack into cars

"electronics, technology, etc. don't always work or are easily hacked - how scary is that"





don't know

By putting wi fi in cars people are distracted causing more and more accidents.

Too much costs-too much tech-too much repairs
some swiper is going to swipe
What if something happens like a malfunction and then



Thete is a posibility that you can be tracked or watched.
The costs for an ordinary car is getting out of hand so that many are not going to be able to afford a car
Needs power


too many factors I wouldn't trust a computer with


I don't know how they would get my information

Its a technology that i feel could have problems with connectivity.  How aboub drivers around your vehicle without this feature.
"I think it could lead to hacking situations, but that that would be extremely rare. No more so than any other ""terrorist"" activity."
Am afraid other people could break in electronically to my car and steal it.

zvcdxb


Any additional technology can cause a security breach nowadays

The government does not and probably cannot guarantee 100 percent secure internet or satellite access and until it does that anything that uses electronics is subject to hacker interference even when not directly connected to the vehicle.  Electronics DO NOT belong in vehicle control other than engine management.
Just wanna keep safe

Too many chances for electrical issues to arise.



It's such a new technology I would worry about malfunctions causing accidents.


"As a older driver, I'll need to develop new driving skills in order to become competent and comfortable enough to trust the new driving perspectives that technology may demand,   I was very cautious when I began to rely more and more on my back car's backup camera.  At the same time I feel technology will encourage some younger drivers to multitask even more recklessly than they already do."

hacking issues



might lock up breaks
mainly because i would not opt to have any of these products on my vehicle

hacking of personal data and schedules

I'm old school. Big brother is watching and I don't care for the world to know my business.


with so many different systems would they really work as intended or cause more rouble for drivers
It's usually pretty well done.  My only concern would be the cost to fix it if it ever broke

it could be hacked into and cause serious problems for the driver




safer


just not
I dont like it









If someone can hack into the car they might get personal information. Seems that systems that can read phones etc. would have to be encrypted well.




Not an issue
"As additional technology is used, there is always the danger of new ways of ""hacking"", etc. to be used."


(1) Invasion of privacy is unacceptable for me. (2) Any system can be hacked.
hacker can invade the system

the odds are very few people have this issue... it';s all media hype



"just can't be trusted and the driver who trusts it too much would be doing other things In the vehicle which could result in an accident.  very, very dangerous technology."
"I know technology does not always follow through. With increase relying on technology, it can become dangerous and make future generations less responsible and more stupid"




life is too busy. driving should be simple.

Unclear to me how this would increase risk relative to current technology.
I don't want personal information to get into wrong hands.
BECAUSE THE NEW TECHNOLOGYS

Concerned about security in all technologies
I feel that it would harder for security to be compromised under these conditions

I am very concern about tha relayability.


costs too much

No

Unless someone hacked into my car i am good in controlling the car. There should be override for the driver to control the car


do not understand well enough
some of your personal data may get in the wrong hands
I am afraid that someone could hack the car.  They would be able to do whatever they wanted

"A car that is connected means a car that can be hacked.  Instead of creating more nutty technology for the sake of technology gadgets for cars, we should instead develop better ways to reduce car usage all together."
to avoid accident

Drivrers ned to drive.  Technology can be confusing.
there are too many factors when driving.
I am just not sure about all of this new stuff!! It's kind of scary in a way!!!



they may malfunction
I would have to be 100 percent sure that it works



"As I have stated before, first of all these systems are vulnerable to hacking. This would make them easier to steal, and from a terrorist's standpoint, what better tool to use for a  bombing than a car without anyone in it that can drive right where you want it to? Also, people are already too lazy and drive distracted. Why give them another tool?  Also, as far fetched as it sounds, hackers could hack in and drive you straight into a brick wall and you couldn't do anything about it."

Have had too many computer crashes

"I just don't trust computers, in addition they themselves are prone to outside intervention."

Computers have glitches and breakdowns.
hard to trust totally with my vehile until proven more

Privacy reasons.
everything gets hacked today




seems like anything can be hacked



not enough research has been done computers make more mistakes than humans

if something goes wrong what can you do?


NOT SAFE
too easy to hack

"I've heard in the news, google self driving vehicle had an accident"
Car security system is enough.
let people drive and be in control


what if the computer blips or is hacked?  Hopefully it functions better than my three year old kindle which freezes and needs to be shut off to reboot


Others can break it down and gain access
"malfunctions, hackers"


Have read how some have used booster devices to get into keyless entry vehicles.  Have also read how some push to start cars can be stolen in a similar way.

everything gets hacked these days
"If I want some one to take over driving, I will take a bus or ride with someone else."

"I am concerned about all wireless technology, as they are capable of being hacked"

it is the responsability at all times for the driver to be in control of their vehicle with out having all this technology interfere with driving

"technology is not fool proof and could fail at any time.  Also, we might become dependent on technology and not pay attention to operating the vehicle"
I am personally not concerned simply because I wouldn't get all the available technologies.




Too many chances of your car being hacked

has nothing to do with me
I don't care if someone knows where I am or where I'm going



reliability not yet proven to me

tech can't think or make dicisions



lot of hackers

because you hear of people hacking into acoounts all the time



To much tech for an old guy
adding things complicates things even more


There has been testing showing that there is little security for cars.  As we become more techonogical with cars and they become self driving we need better security.  Lives are at stake.
it is making the car to be a little more complex and harder to make use of all the technologies

Technology fails frequently






I am not familiar enough to know what the capabilities are but sounds like it could be a problem if security was threatened

nothing
not familiar with that technology



great



Safety and hacking

Anything can be hacked.
because somehow it attracts thieves to want to break it because of the high tech
What is there to be concerned about?
Not interested
"Not needed by me, I don't drive often enough."

I think there is too much additional technology now and it tends to confuse the older driver

too many ways for someone or something to interfer


don't trust



concerned about vehicle hacking

so many thing are happing now tell anything could happen

because  the new technologies  are out  of reach for me


because im not

more technical options can be hacked
a car is meant to be driven by a person not controlled by a computer that could crash
"Security, hacking could be possible"

Too much technology is not a good thing



"My biggest concern is what happens when something goes wrong with that technology.  Car companies have so many recalls of things manufactured incorrectly now why add any more.  Also, I truly don't believe any technology can react better than a human being to a possible traffic issue...good drivers can watch and predict what might happen much better"
not yet tested to full extend but would consider in future


Just not sure how the technology works and how safe it is.
not sure

the cost

too many things could go wrong
What about it concerns security?
Nots sure

Something could happen and there would be an accident




none
Why worry when there is nothing you can do about it.
Hackers are everywhere

It is only money


it is unknown to me so I am concerned

"I guess I'm just not a worry wort!  I believe the car companies will (or, at least, SHOULD) keep us safe and secure."
With technology comes security issues and this really concerns me and my personal safety and identity.

"Because electronics fail sometimes.  When that happens, who will be held responsible?"
"More technology is more chance of problems with failure of the device. Also, drivers will become lazier than they already are with the new technologies and when failure of the system occurs, which it will happen, they will be less prepared for the failure and the result could be devastating."
everything seems to be able to be hacked
I have driven a car for many years without a huge list of options and I do not want to start now
"Not only is that way too many distractions in the car for the driver, but the more you put this expensive technology into a car the more things you will have to stop working properly and need repair.  However if too many things go wrong at the same time that could also be dangerous;"

It will be safer
might have a glitch

hackers. it may not be as safe as it sounds

"Not just hackers, but computer or software failure is a big potential problem."
Because wtf.

Never really thought about it

you can never program for all situations in traffic.  taking away the human decision making leaves you protected by only the capabilities programmed in

Many times new technology has bugs or problems with it when it is first introduced.
Scarey

I like to have full control of my vehicle. I believe things can go wrong with computers.



anything can malfunction
hackers have already figured out how to take over control of such vehicles and obtain  other private information
Just don't trust
"major companies, including car manufacturers, have already experienced hacking attempts. i don't think you can ever make technology totally secure."


I just don't know that much about them and also things can go wrong quickly on them sometimes.
to many gadgets make it unsafe
It could malfunction


Scares me


if  it  will  work

hacking capability
Could lead to more theft of cars



i'm not sure
It has not been tested fully and things break.  What keeps a computer in the car from rear ending someone or increasing the speed of the car when it should be decreasing the speed?  How are computers overtaken so that the driver actually has control?  Those are my concerns.


it is unknown fro me
n/a


I wouldnt trust it to work correctly.
want to keep control

trudtrudrtusytydrtydrtydtydtrydryyyy




I believe the additional technology increases the risk of theft of the vehicle. People would want to steal these vehicles for the value they would bring on the black market.


I worry sometimes about how much technology is advancing that it opens us up to more attacks






have to know more
Safety concerns


there is always somebody hacking into things like this

na



its a scary thing

"it seems for everything good, there is an override and too many systems would be overridden and rendered unsafe."
It is just another avenue for security breaches to occur


something else to hack.
"Just a few days ago, security officials testified to Congress that they would be willing to use smart home tech to spy on people; they would most certainly be very willing to do the same thing with vehicles."


"The more ""connected"" items available, the more potential for hacking and data mining."
security
insurance or authorities getting hold to the information
there is computer failure all the time systems crash as well as people
there's nothing to cause me to mistrust security safeguards
Im just not interested
"I would be hoping that they work properly, because I would be relying on them"
Technology can fail and is constantly being recalled or in for service
Trust the technology.  Driving a vehicle is always scary
To get into my car and say Car drive me to Walmart and for me to sit back and do nothing would freak me out!    When you are on a bus full of people you see a driver.   You know the train has a driver and a conductor.   I am trying to think of what transportation would not have a human driver on board.  I have never been on a subway but maybe that has not driver and I know a Tram that goes up the mountain has no driver.    It would be scary to me but I am sure it is coming our way.
i CANNOT IMAGINE IT'S RELIABILITY AT THIS TIME. fUTURE MAY TELL
scary

I am a safe driver and am not concerned about what the other car may or may not have.


They would have to of tested it out first.
mechanical failures could cause needless accidents.

just not concerned

no


have not witnessed any thing like this personally but people need to step up and take care of their responsibilities
"It's just like our smartphones, or tablets, just need to take the right precautions"
Technology that involves advanced functionality is still somewhat unreliable. Too many things to go wrong in such complex systems.

haven't been proven enough

other drivers
computer-based technology is too easily accessed by others and creates a real concern for me
Converting all vehicles over to electronic computer control programs exposes everyone to the risk of error or fault caused by someone providing false information and creating havoc.
hopefully to complex for someone to hack into
if sydtem goes down could be major issues
"I don't trust any connected technologies in general. All are open to theft, modification and could be more harmful than good if that occured"


just more things to go wrong and costly to fix
There is so much tech in our lives everywhere already
Thief of identify


It would say that I am somewhat concerned because I know people who have had these issues.
Not in control all the time
"I don't quite understand the security issue. Is it the possibility of someone stealing it, or is it that I would feel secure of technology working? I think depending too much on technology and electronics that can fail at any time is not worth my life."
"technology does break down, and not work at times, dont trust a large vehicle on the road"

not sure


adequate safeguards need to be built into the technology to prevent them from being hacked or used against drivers in ways that they were not designed


I have never had a problem with security.
Malfunctions

concerned about identity theft


"need more information about the technology, is It using wireless technology? is there a signal floating around thaqt can be intercepted and reversed. need more info to make a decision"



I am concerned about being hacked on any device when I am in cyberspace. I hope this system would have internet security automatically attached/available with purchase of vehicle with this system
"with so much technology in cars today, I worry that my car could be hacked and taken over, maybe causing a serious accident"
to easy to hack into

don't think they are safe
just another way for people to try and steal your identity





"If I want to take a bus and ""leave the driving to us"" that's what I'd do."
"I think it would just raise the price, more things to go wrong."
There are other drivers on the road
too much info is sometimes a bad thing

Just another way for your information to be stolen...



there is never enough safety when you are driving





Too many eyes and ears could be into it


I would not purchase most of the options anyway. The ones i would buy do not seem to be invasive.

Feel it's safe


I am very careful about locking my car by pressing the lock button on the car instead of using the fob.  I understand that controlling with the fob may be hacked and that someone could get into my car.


it is impotant
If some of these car makers now cant control a Air Bag how in the HELL are they going to control this?
kust not concerned...

it wouldn't keep out  people wanting to steal the car but would probably keep me out

it seems to be so easy now for hackers to do just about anything

too much techo;ogy can have problems you know how computers are
many distractions
I have seen how technology enhances todays driving so I am not conccerned about going forward with more new technology in cars!

I do not trust them to work every time.

"Again, I believe that it is the DRIVER'S responsibility to monitor road/traffic/obstacle conditions, without relying on technology. Also, many things can go wrong with the technology, especially if it is new technology, and, again, it would add to the already high cost of a new vehicle."





Look at people who drive while talking on their cell phones. They don't pay attention to the trafic. Same would be true for technology intergration
hackers could mess with my car and cause an accident

too easy to be hacked


some things can't be accounted for

weqeer
"its run by a computer, computers crash, malfunction , able to be hacked  cost to repair would be out of sight, look at the cost of the computer that runs a car now, what would this computer cost"


We already have hackers out there hacking into people bank accounts with all this technology in the car it wouldn't be safe anymore. It would not be safe because I can no longer physically control the vehicle if it is driving by it self. If some hacker comes by hacks the car and makes it turn into another car what then?

faith in new technolage


not sure how refined the technology is right now

too expensive
don't use or want

"As mentioned, any vehicle using overall computer driven systems could be hacked and cause irreparable damage to many.  What guarantees would the company provide to prevent hacking and what would it do, if the system was hacked??"

Mos the items discussed are basically added on do-dads that are not at all necessary nor are they much of a benefit to the main purpose of a car.  Any technology has risks involved.  In this case unnecessary risks.

You cant trust technology
Would be interested when have a computer with 99.99% reliability no breakdown for any reason


"When I think about security in vehicles, I think of authorized vehicle entry and operation, not automatic driving capability. In general, I am very concerned about identity theft and worry the an automobile that's privy to personal information is just one more possibility for information to fall into inappropriate hands.   Passwords, finger print access, etc could resolve these issues for me."
everything is tied to the fool smartphone and they are not very secure to the vulnerabilities then transfer to the vehicle relying on the smartphone tech
"When a vehicle is integrated with a lot of technology, there are always ""hackers"" that can infiltrate the system and perhaps cause a problem while driving. Also, having your fingerprints scanned, etc., is self explanatory why that could be a problem if in the hands of the wrong people."
nithing
Reliability and the ability of the system to be taken over by someone other than the driver (hackers).



I see these technologies as a way to raise the price of the vehicles the manufacturers make and have more profit




I think there is too much technology incorporated in todays vehicles. It drives up the initial cost & cost of repairs when they malfunction.
TOO EXPENSIVE
What if a terrorist could hack self driving vehicles and cause them all to crash / it's unlikely but possible.
"hearing on the news that that computer hackers can gain access to cars technology is scary enough. and having a car self driving, self parking no way besides computers aren't 100% ever"


I would think there would be a lot of testing around this due to the potential risk it could cause if the technology didn't work.

there will always be something new.

"this would allow someone to know where the car is at any time, i.e. away from home,  plus I think the government knows enough about us as it is."
they tend to fail and make mistakes

I would probably wait until the new technology has been out for a while just to make sure that it is proven to be safe.

I would like to have this kind of technology but I might worry about the technology not working when I need it.
A vehicle is a machine -- machines break down -- then they are expensive to fix

there are always glitches and also hacking
"Who gets to know the location of my vehicle, what data does it retain, I  vehiclewould like to know these things before I have them in my vehicle"

Just like all technology it is great when it works!!!
I tend to wonder how secure it is when it comes to being reliable in situations and whether or not it may actually increase the risk of something bad happening if something were to go wrong. And in another respect i wonder how vulnerable my vehicle may be to hackers who may maliciously want to gain access to my vehicle for whatever reasons.
Hackers could hack cars. But I'm also concern about the cost of repairs if needed

I would not buy the items
Don't think technology can replace human ability to make quick decisions about potential problems
"the technology is too new, plus they would have to make it very secure"






sounds unsafe


anything can be hacked






its innovative
too much technology make people stupid & too reliant on technology that can fail





We have to protect our wallets from RF thieves. I can only imagine there will be a drive-by way to steal service being used onboard an automobile.


More technology will make it possible for more to go wrong and most of this new technology is not ready for general use
I like to be in control as driver.


"currently U.S. vehicles are very easy to hack into and from their, hackers can migrate into other connected technologies in the vehicle.  I realize I'm a anachronism, but I've had students and other young people walk directly in front of my vehicle while using their mobile devices and then get mad at me. People are no longer being responsible for their own behavior"
need it

good to have it

"people hack banks and cause chaos, when they hack cars it'd cause accidents and lives"


Nearly *all* depend on external communications which *could* be monitored and the information used to the unapproved *receiver's* benefit.
"Out in the driving world, the exposure to nearby hackers would increase by a major amount."

"Hackers will still find a way to steal cars, grab your data, whatever they want. As technology progresses so do their means of getting information."
"I have seen too many TV shows where such technologies in cars already have been used for criminal activities, evil deeds.  Even though TV fiction, it makes you stop and think."
It has already been shown that hackers can hack into such systems and take control of your car. I don't remember the exact make or model involved.
Hsckersd
There is just too much that could go wrong.  People can get too complacent and rely on the technology and then cannot react quickly enough when they need to

you see all these news stories about vehicles not function properly and getting in accidents.  How can I trust my car and family to a technology which might go wrong?
There are always glitches
the tec in the cars can make a better driving for the user
the more things you add on the more things can go wrong
not sure who is collecting the info and what they are doing with the info
Too many people out there thatight have acvrss to my metwork
just not to sure of safety
it can be hacked

Nothing to hide.


I think that is great for people who want it .I just do not.
"additional technology means additional repair possibilities. i know computers and they really should not even work at all. there is also the issue of security. someone, somewhere is collecting that data. i want to know what they are doing with it and how they are protecting it."


as of right now you need to know it is safe


no need
"Cars can be hacked; they may or may not stop in time if there is a pile up on the freeway; they may or may not respond quickly enough if a car swerves into one's lane. Unless all cars become automatically driven, they could lead to higher accidents. Technology still has a way to go till I would feel safe enough in this."
If it breaks down it would be expensive to fix.


Don't like the thought of losing control and being led by a robot



I think that taking away a goodly amount of driver control is not that all desireable
Cars have been hacked. They will continue to be hacked. Until the hackers are put in charge of security.
Too much technology now
none

Technology can be a wonderful thing. I also believe being able to rely on ones common sense is a better option. Security is what each and every person is comfortable within themself.
When it comes to technology there's always a concern about security.
"I like to drive the car, not rely on technology"
Technology does not always work......would not feel safe.




no need
Most technology has security concerns so I would be skeptical
mbbjnkjn
"Technology that depends on input from outside the automobile can be tampered with.  Also anytime a computer can override the driver input you are asking for trouble.  Add to that that thieves can learn the technology to override systems to easily steal cars.  I would feel safer driving a Model T than an auto that a computer has more input into than the driver.  If you are to lazy to drive get a taxi, ride a bus, or hire a chauffer."

Technology in cars complicates cars . I like them simple.

Because. What if they don't work
fixing problem
"TOO MUCH STUFF TO OPERATE , LIKE AN AIRPLANE MONITOR, COULD BE TOO DISTRACTING WHEN DRIVING"


"Its all a matter of first come first serve, and I am not sure how these will be integrated or used properly while driving"




I think humans make tons of errors. Computers are programmed and therefore there is very little room for error.


They can be hacked
Mistakes happen

who knows if someone could hack into the system and control the car themselves?
Hackers seem to find their way into computers all the time.  you often hear about some kind of security breech.  It is possible that the security could be compromised in some way.



violates personal privacy

cars are not smarter than humans



"not sure  my info would be kept safe, not sure if hackers could remotely control my car"

like it old school
I feel certain that the additional technology would be well tested before adopted by the auto industry
because I would be afraid of being hacked


Because the technology sometimes is not smart enough.


The technology is probably in the beginning stages of this technology. It would depend mostly on the ability of the device to avoid all instances that might occur. Right now I don't think there's enough info to make an intelligent decision on something like this. I'm also concerned that the system has the ability to guard against someone trying to hack into the system.

"It is going to fast, you learn one thing then they throw another in your car.  Unneccessary"
"I do not want my life information out there and I do not want 'big brother' knowing my every move in life. Also if they can 'hack' a car computer, what else in the vehicle can they get into."
Because of increased traffic on roads
I just think these features are able to detect people and their devices by scanning & could possibly be getting their personal information. Also I worry about the safety & security of the vehicle itself.




"People are able to break into the technology, break into the car, override your car, etc."
i am concerned the safety.





nothing  someone could do to harm me
saw a TV report about cars being hacked and taken over
Technologies can be hacked.
thoroughly tested before marketing
idiotic

Corruptness
Lots of reasons
If  I  need  it





It is a problem as there is always someone who can find some way to do it

Feel so
Duh???????

Concerns due to any flaws in the system


have not experienced any problems with this so far nor know anyone who has


WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO HACK INTO A VEHICLE IT JUST SEEMS
"Technology is taking over everything, pretty soon, we will not have to do anything, machines will be doing it all.  There is a little concern about having a car drive itself."

na
i trust them
I don't do anything that would make me worry about my security and no one would want my identity cause i have horrible credit

Some decision has to be made by visual cues which smart technology cannot take.
dxfhdrh




more to go wrong
na
I have more trust in a human being driving a vehicle as compared to a robot  driving a vehicle.

they can malfunction on you
I don't like it-if you aren't conscious enough to drive-you shouldn't be on the road

Hacking



sounds like it might be easy for hackers to tap into.  better safe than sorry

Because I have heard the story of the car that was put into the ditch remotely by someone who hacked into the car's system.


"Because I only have blue tooth. I do not need extra technology. Why would I? I am driving, not at home. I have a computer at home for that."





hacking seems to be a problem these days
"to much over reach in technology, too many variables involved"
none


It has been shown that car electronic systems have been hacked
easy target for hackers
Already have seen tests that show a car's systems can be hacked and controlled remotely.
because it seems that any computer can be hacked at any time


"technology not made to last,too expensive and cannot think like a human"

nothing

it must be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt before i would consider it

These are all there for my safety and protection
a lot of drivers are in a major hurry and would cause issues
"Hacking into the system can make me vulnerable to identity theft, causing accidents, tracking my movements, etc."



no need



the current options don't work well add more to have more things not work well
too many things to hack
everything will work in time. the bugs will be worked out of all ad ons eventually
Manufactures need to stay on top of security which they have been lax at.
The security of additional technology integration will deter break-ins and make driving safer

"because the tech needs to be improved before people start trusting it, its shown to be easy to hack"
"driving was meant to be total concentration on what you are doing, not with how much technology we can load into a vehicle to take your attention away from the road,  Some of these new ideas of technology are crazy.  The more access you have to some of these ideas the more there is the ability to hack into by individuals who have nothing better to do than scheme and create problems"
na


I feel you are adding too many distractions for the driver
"Automobiles are for driving by responsible attentive drivers. No entertainment, no robot driving, no superfluous technology."



"Too new, do not trust it.  Could cause accidents, then who is responsible, the owner of the car or the car manufacturer?"
no interest



I assume the car manufacturers know what they are doing


just could not trust
too much money and too much government control on what we need in cars


Too many hacks out there


I am not acquainted with if the technology is already secure.


still need to prove it will work as good as a human
"it is a bit concerning, things can go wrong"

I think it is awesome to have this technology but don't completely trust it yet.  I would wait to purchase when it has been thoroughly tested and out for awhile.
it is all so new

Too much info is is cyberspace and is easily hacked
"When people depend upon technology to perform tasks that they have done in the past, they do not stay focused to tasks that need constant attention and changes that may occur."
NOT WORRIED




If the vehicle gets into an accident who pays. Me or the Manufacturer.  Will my insurance cost more or less
it's just a car



Just the unfamiliarity
do not feel safe


Cars with CURRENT technology features are hackable right now.
not sure of reliability and possibility of malfunction

too much distraction for far too many drivers already without additional tech distractions



known locations and tracking
I always concerned about security
think that technology can react faster than driver

dont have a need
Change - without using it and experiencing the new technology it is hard to understand it all.
Too easy to hack into anything today




actually I am very concerned and would not  buy if the vehicle has these things in it.

"Tech is making it safer in most cases, not the other way around."

that it could be hacked.


Too much info
I have been accident  free for 20 yrs with no extra cost
Just another way to track consumers and know what they are doing at all times.
Because I know electronics in new cars can be hacked and possible result in a wreck





"Since it would be technology based on software and firmware programs, I would be concerned about code errors and system failures as well as potential hacking and causing accidents."
hackers
technology has a way of failing


People become to complacent
Someone would learn how to hack into this system and steal your information........................
i don't have it and hope vehicles that do are still maintained by the human touch
Always a concern



Hackers

don't know


doesn't always have to know everything about where you are or what your doing. wants way too much personal info.

takes your attention away from driving


not a robot car




Any computer can be hacked.  I don't want to be driving down the road and someone take over my car.

"The more technology integrated, the more distraction to the driver."
Why shall I? We are not afraid of implementing automation in every other field of life

"If there's a glitch with the system, I'm not in control."

the internet is volnerable

Needs a lot testing still.  Somewhat concerned about hackers having fun at the riders expense.
I am afraid of self driving cars and how drivers will react to them. Promotes laziness of the driver.

wonder how much info it would gather and where does the info go
don't trust technology.  Computers are not reliable 100% of the time; what makes me think this technology will be???  I trust myself more than all these gadgets
Will not affect me

Technology is not foolproof. Things always go wrong. I do not want others to have access to my habits and data.

necessity

More breakins
"i,ll share this lease"
they can't see everything


"Technology cannot always be trusted to work properly.  Can an outside computer hacker (assuming most of the technology is computerized), hack into the technology and control your car, i.e. as in a self-driven car.   If a driver is in an accident in a self-driven car (""driverless car""), do you sue the car manufacturer for the accident???"
"We've already had issues with hackers taking over a Jeep Cherokee, and the more technology is integrated with cars, the greater the chance for additional hacker problems."

"do not trust this technology at all, cause a lot of issues for real drivers, etc."
I don't like the idea of a machine doing the thinking.








I have confidence in the technology companies to have adequate security.


"Bad people getting control of your car, data being send or sold to companies."
I just don;t trust  all this technology that can go wrong as I have a computer that goes wild at time

no need for it

You should always be safety conscious


I can't imagine giving up all control of a vehicle to a system.  I would have to have a lot of proof that it is safe before I would be iterested
one always should be concerned about the security of any thing




more technology = more hacking/intrusion

more things to draw attention of drivers from the road. there are too many distracted idiots out there now.
NA

probably would save money for insurance costs.




hard to believe and trust
you never know
just am

sometimes there is so many things going on that oit is distracting for the driver.




"I have some concern for my privacy, there are a lot of hackers out there"
I trust the vehicle manufacturers to have tested and adequately developed security protection.
too much big brother now

too much room for hackers to do bad things!


none
"The more technology, the more potential harm could be done by hackers."

i love driving the car myself   its not a taxi

I don't trust all this new technology - it seems like it would be easy to hack and get others information



I don't trust it
I feel they are not safe

"I would feel like someone is monitoring/tracking my driving, and I definitely would not like that."

i have no concern about these things

anything can be hacked

I'm old school

There is so much technology now that works
technology always have some type of malfunctions

Considering the number of repairs and recalls that occur on autos today it makes you question how reliable these would be.
N/a


potential to override human common sense
They are already doing it and never told anyone.



"The current ability of hackers is so prevalent in other products, it's been in the news that they can do so now with the current vehicles."
I simply don/t trust it
"Vehicles can be hacked and hijacked,"
the new advancement are a type of technology which will serve to enhance the car's security and safety and not hinder it
Trust the makers to make it safe and secure
Malfunctions can happen. If a driver trusts technology too much and isn't paying attention an accident may not be avoided.

price
afraid some could hack into my car and make me have an accident


"A lot of new technology can be connected to or read by anything that has wi-fi, etc. The more technological things become, the easier it is to control them with other technology."

It would be too easy to hack.
unsure


"technique is not far enough to go really on the roads, see like problems with google car"




"I am concerned that the more personal information we make available in and through our cars, the more at risk this information becomes."

All technology can break down at one point and it would be horrific if that were to happen with some thing that is controlling the vehicle
Just don't see it as an issue
Until it is tested I don't want it


i'm old

Na
We are human and we make mistakes. The first thing that is going to happen I that we believe the car can drive itself and something goes wrong and someone is hurt. Solve the human equation and then I'll believe.
might make a error
seems like there would be more chance for error if there is a system failure



no comment
crooks r finding ways to get in regardless


Because if you are talking about stealing people will always find a way to get something that does not belong to them no matter how hard you try to keep it from them.



I am not an early adaptor.  I would want to see how it works for others before I would use it myself.

Too Much Government Control!  Very Likely To Be Used For Spying!

Don't know
Alot of information being shared beyond our control


I don't worry about much





Hackers have already broken into car systems - more automation means more possibility of hacking

Would the vehicle always operate in a safe manner.
because I have a vehicle
I will not be buying the added technology to my vehicle



cost
just some
cost
like to have control over my own things to many gadets in cars make them more prone to be broken into

no
I'm sure it would all be well tested.
too  much   nfromation for outsiders to steal
too much information can be recorded
I am a basic type of person and expensive extras aren't for me
Cars have recalls all the time. Definitely scary thought is a self-driving car that gets a recall. You're going to have a lot of seniors on the road in the next 20 years. Why don't you target their 40 somethings to get their 70 year old parents a car that drives for them so you don't have to worry about them driving forward when they should be in reverse.
Ther are more important and ptofitable things to hack than my car
"Like computers, they work great when they are working, but what happens when it breaks or has a tech problem ? How safe is the car ?"


"If hacked, it could be deadly"
I feel that technology may be hacked and security compromised.

easy to hack and cause accidents
"I'm nearly certain most of this is spurred by the insurance industry and governments wanting to use less fuel.  If they can make everyone go at the same speed, separated by a prescribed space, accidents would be at a level of nearly zero, and the pace would be such that gas would be predictable.  i am not interested in the transmission of so much data to a computer in a vehicle, or possibly pay for the upload by my cell plan.  Data is so valuable, is hijacked all the time."
the more technology the more someone would want to steal or break into the car

You could potentially have the car hacked into

not really sure technology can read all the things that go on around a car




if im going to get killed in a car wreck I don't want to be killed by a machine

like all mechanical and electronics  can and will fail at times
there are enough tech already incorporated


its new therefore there is a concern.
Security is always an issue.
not sure
I would have major concerns with safety. I am concerned that the vehicle computer system could be hacked causing an accident.

n/a

people are always figuring out how to hack into computers and other devices.







people should be driving not computers
"In one word- Hackers! Never underestimate the bastards! If they can get into NORAD and the Space Centre and the CIA, how safe is MY system from them?"



fgujcf
I think this needs much more testing before I would be comfortable with it.
prefer not to answer

There can always be flaws but I am sure the tech is relatively safe since manufacturers would be under strict liability
Hacking
"The more things that are computerized, leaves hackers open to a whole new world."

"I more concerned about the ability to keep my data secure than the ability keep me safe from injury say in a self driving car.  In today's litigation minded society, the manufacturers will not put out a feature without extensive testing, especially when it comes to safety.  Like a said, data security is my major concern."
"do not my vehicle to be hacked and stolen, controlled by or communicating with anyone else including the government"


"Cars, like other computers, are subject to Cyber Attack, the more technology that is introduced without dealing with that potential, leaves the vehicle, it's owner and any passengers vulnerable."

too invasive

I think advanced technology can open a person up to more adept individuals who might take advantage of the situation.
dfgdfgdf
More technology features could make burglary an greater risk.
THEY COULD CAUSE VEHILE TO SHOW DOWN WITH NO WAY TO RESTART ON A FREEWAY OR CROWDED CITY STREET
haven't really given it much thought

anything is hackable

too expensive

i like to control a vehicle
fdfdfdfdfd
Smacks of Big brother. Already tethered to smartphone...don't need insurance companies or others tracking what I do.


it is helpful
I have hacking concerns

no comment.






Hackers exist all over driven by a range of motivation.  It is easy to envision parties hacking into vehicles just for the fun of it and causing chaos.


not sure if it can be hacked and possible damaging my vehicle
"If people can ""hack"" into NASA, they can (and HAVE) hack into a vehicle with all this computer/automated technology."
to many things could go wrong.
what happens if it breaks down?
don't trust it
I have faith in my driving habits and skills and have no problem with anyone keeping tack of my travels or abilities.



i wouldnt worry to much if they were in mass production then others could complain as well if this does happen
it may distract some drivers by them paying attention to all the little bells and whistles and more things that could go wrong costing money to repair
Hackers could endanger lives.
More and more you see companies getting hacked and people's information being stolen.  It is only a matter of time before these hacks start being on automobiles.  These types of things are already showing up in television shows and movies.


not proven
i dont believe i have anything saved on my phone that would be a threat to me if someone was able to access it
to many people would try to hack into them.

Computer hackers get into everything electronic for monetary gain as well as for malicious purposes.  I worry about any personal information stored in the system being accessed without my approval (privacy concerns here also) as well as someone rending my vehical unusable or unsafe by screwing with the systems (such as changing the safe following distance in an adaptive cruise control to make the car un-driveable or changing the system so the little hide away door handles will not pop out)

"I feel like it opens you up to so many attacks, i.e. hacking. If your phone is connected to the car with allowed internet access - who knows what someone can do with your personal information. It's one thing to have a phone hacked, it's another to have a hacker hijack your car at 55mph."

I'm not sure what there is to be concerned about


like computers they can be hacked
Too mnay computer hackers today plus all technology experiences glitches and freezes
"like falling off a cliff, if you are not near the edge you will not fall off.  Don't buy into these unnecessary gadgets and nothing will happen."
its still new




It is troubling to have so much data-intervention.


That some one could hack in and take control of the car need very good security

sometimes things can be overdone and this technology is a perfect example.


I just want a vehicle to get me from one place to another.



no reason to believe this is a real threat
"I am just not on board with self driving technology, it seems that too many bad things can go wrong. We already seem to have tons of accidents with people driving while distracted, if people were not even paying attention at all and something was about to happen or the car malfunctioned how many more accidents would we have. It is still just too advanced for my liking."





one glidge is enough to create havoc






any sharing and transmission of information poses a potential risk--which happens all the time
"I am one of these people that just likes having as much technology as I can afford, providing it is safe to operate during driving or makes my driving experience more enjoyable."



qwertyuiop



better tech the more theifs want it




"I believe each of the technology options are good.  However, it should be the driver's option to choose them individually.  I don't like bundling of available options.  My new Jeep does not have electronic seat positioning because I had to buy heated seats to get it.  In addition, I enjoy driving with a manual transmission. I was told I could not get electronic seats with a manual transmission.  So I don't have the electronic seat adjustment.  I am a very young 68 and manually adjust the seat."




id theft

It gives people a feeling that they don't have to pay attention at all.  I find that to be dangerous.

Don't want public agencies tracking my movements
Buglary


Could be hacked by someone to steal car
the integration of new technology needs testing before implementing



N/A


I trust the technology
if has a tendency to fail as with all made by man/

I chose not to obtain many of the newest options
more concerned about repair costs actually



Afraid of hacking.
there have been instances already of people hacking into automobile technology on cars
very leery of new untried technology





"it something fails, I, the human am still responisible for the car and not the computer or software."
believable
the more technology the more someone can use it to help themselves to your information
would not trust them


Too new and vunerable to hackers.
"still in testing phase, fear of unknown"

the ability to hack or change technology devices these days make it rather prohibitive to have too many technology related features integrated to my vehicle's functioning power

well i said not at all.   like automation just not overall vehicle control.  think some of the automation helps are great.
"I dont think that any of those items will impede a driving, they will help if anything"

"machines do break, I do not like not being on control."
With increasing technology comes increased security as well

Hacking right now is a big problem if my car gets hacked it could be a problem..

big brother

"It is about being hacked and if hackers can they will cause trouble. In what way, I don't know."
Afraid it would stop working

I am somewhat concerned because of the devious intents of persons who think it's fun to hack into technology.


"without proper security software and firewalls the vehicle could be hacked and overriden by an outside user. Also, there could be a hack and a virus implanted that could affect the performance of the system."

Not sure

distraction

"We continue to have security problems with internet based technology, and I would not feel safe relying on a machine to drive my auto."
"I'd prefer to DRIVE my vehicle, so this technology is of no use to me"
anyone could get in and drive away with it.







More opportunity to get targeted
Safety of my information.





I do not trust technology 100%
"they receive too much date, but can not react to change fast enough"


"people are into hacking things daily. and it would be easy to hack into a system like that.... just like breaking into homes, etal. there are nuts out there."
I would worry about security and if someone could access my data remot
I don't want someone to take control of my car.
"the additional technology will help with accident prevention, safe to use and securitywould be good"




its too freaky
Some could hack the new technology. It doesn't feel safer with more technology in vehicles.


I'm worried people could get too much information about my location and driving habits

great
Hacking is becoming more common and I do not trust that the technology is hack proof




good
"technology is good when tested and proven, but it would equally fail or malfunction."

everything is hackable

"Unintentional viruses, or glitches"
always a criminal looking to exploit tech
have already shown that car's computer can be hacked and I rather not be tracked by anyone


"do u see what is happening today with security breaches on credit cards, banks, personal records etc - all focused on technology,how safe do u really believe autonomous autos will be once the hackers start attacking this new technology, I can see hackers and terrorists getting control of all this and creating real havoc on the highways"




I think you can be tracked by security and I do not like other people knowing about me
na
I would be worried about crashing or gliches in techonoligies
I am concerned that a machine can't effectively assess all of the obstacles around it and that it will actually be more dangerous when a person relies on a machine to keep him/herself safe while the vehicle is moving.
I think it is easier for hackers to get into your vehicle electronics and cause problems.


I am always worried about safety
Humans make errors but I don't trust computers that much.
BIG BROTHER
I am leery of a car driving iteself
others do not need to know what I am doing or going

"I think that when things are run by computers there is a higher risk of someone being able to ""hack"" into that system, and use that info to get into your car."
"if technology fails, it could cause problems"

FUN


I would be afraid of the possibility of another driver being able to hijack control of my vehicle.

Driverless cars still need to be perfected



It's too easy to hack computers


"Without a proper firewall all technology is vulnerable and even with one it is still vulnerable to jerks, assholes and hackers.  Car companies are there to make money and not provide safety from potential threats."
no

none
There's so many drivers on the road I'm not concerned I would be one of the victims

"To me these features are expenses that most people could not afford or need for that matter. Maybe the younger generation or tech savvy people would want them, but my husband and I don't. These would be features that could break down and cost a fortune to fix. Personally, I don't see the need for all of them or most of them anyway. call me an old fogey if you want, but that's the way I see it."

too much technology and computers opens many doors for hackers
more technological distractions might lead to more accidents

"Technology is vulnerable. The more technology in vehicles, the more vulnerable they become."
good stuff

Because it helps safe driving and encourages new driver new drivers to be safe and secure by themselves .

Any time new technology is imposed not only on vehicles but in general there is always the getting the bugs out phase. I do not want my life to be in jeopardy with unproven technology.

too much technology on car that will break down
I watched the driverless  car being demonstrated on Tv. Thought it looked and sounded too dangerous to me.  I think a real person is much safer.
Because technology fails

It is easier for people to hack into all your personal information when everything is wireless.
"I would not need all the extra devices this entails, so I'm not concerned about having it."

glitches!

people would be too reliant on technology

Remember the Toyota acceleration issue?? Technology has glitches all the time. Technology can also be hacked.
"People are already careless and distracted. This technology will cause them to feel a false sense of security and they will be texting, talking, etc... even more than now."
not sure

getting too complicated
hacking
we all know computers fail every so often



can't replace the human element
"the more technology integrated is live apps the more ""they"" are watching you."
I trust myself more
"Hacking, computer malfunctions. etc.  Different problems from humans, but still would be problems."


not neded

it still different if a human would control it
Safety is the most important part.




like the features
Too risky
Breeches

can be hack

I think putting too much into a car could lead to hacking the systems and causing crashes.

These are great concepts
lnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

High jack
"Cars, like private homes, should not be surveilled as long as traffic laws are obeyed. If no traffic laws are broken, there is absolutely no reason to monitor what is being said inside a car or where the driver/passengers are going"
Not sure
Even the government gets hacked.  I do not want to become overly dependent on unproven technology when failure would cost many lives.
Because there are many things that human beings do not interact but they are useful at the time



HACKERS COULD SABOTAGE THE CAR
"I am more concerned with cyber security of vehicles, than with the vehicles ability to drive itself.   I believe the technology will be amazingly precise, but open to cyber attacks."

"I am afraid that the technology in the new cars can be hacked, so you may lose control"
too muchof a chance of someone hacking information
humans design the additional technology and where there are humans there is the potential for errors
Sometimes their unnecessary additions.
"Read about hacking all the time. Then there are privacy issues. Also, in general, the more technology, the more things that can go wrong."
More features could be more distractions which can cause accidents

While technology is great my concern is that too much can be evil.  Things can go wrong and systems can be breached.
I'm fearless! I'm not afraid of anything.


"seem to be to many distrations for the driver, we have enough as it is"
no system is totally secure. therefore someone else may take control of your vehicle

fdbdbd

Who knows what hacking will do



none



What if the system fails? it'd be a disaster

there have been problems in the past.  Security is always a problem
don;t need  to have a car with no driver


i am concerned that it would create too many accidents
All connected technology is at risk of being hacked.  I've already heard about Chrysler/Jeep being hacked and control of the car taken over by an outside system.  Even the US military has concerns with their F-35 being hacked.
"Because, I'm not sure how safe the new technology is."
already been proven the system can be hacked
"Regardless of what we think, people are smarter than computers and always find a way to get around security measures. With so many corporations information being hacked into each year, I do not feel that vehicles would be any different. It would only be a matter of time until someone figured out how to remotely control the vehicle and caused problems."

"I am concerned with others' ability to hack into vehicles. In addition, I am concerned about sharing of information/what use that information will be put to."
simply someone hacking into the technology and take control

People are paranoid. No need to be


I said I don't know I don't own a car my son is the one with the car

Need some human interaction.  Cannot trust technology to consider all conditions


it would cause people to be distracted
To much info




The technology needs to mature before I would feel total comfortable.

"No more so than any other technology.  If you worry about such things, any technological advance will bother you.  I refuse to live scared"

Fun times
"The vehicle manufacturer's already run the numbers to see if a recall is warranted, these are the same people developing technology to drive people in vehicle without my intervention. Guess it comes down to a trust issue."

it may make it is easy to disclose my information

it seems like it would be a good deal


"In your own words, please explain why you say you are somewhat concerned about the security of additional technology integration in vehicles."
I just for the life of me don't understand this type of technology
to much stuff run by machines

someone could hack the system



"Why does it matter? Im living life trying to get to work or get food for my family. Why would any industry want to interfere with that? They wouldn't, its a waste of their time and money."








I just am concerned about anything that has to do with technology today.
I'm concerned that someone could hack into the system and cause malfunctions or even steal the car

"It just seems like security is becoming an ever-increasing problem in general, so not having as much potentially vulnerable technology in a vehicle makes sense to me.  I've managed just fine without these devices for years."




none

people are stupid computers are smarter
I would be afraid of someone hacking into the system.


it can mess up
Don't trust tracking of my activities




nice


Technology driven vehicles will be much safer than those driven by error prone humans.
Too many ways the programs in a car could get hacked by an outside source and take control of the vehicle.
There are too many hackers out and sometimes technology can be burdensome
The technology is very good but it can always happen something
I live in a rural area and do not think the risk here is that great.

I would think that the car manufacturers would ensure that the technology is safe and secure to use.
"I usually trust technology integration in vehicles, but I get little bit concerned when I see the news regarding recalls. That makes me worried."


I would be afraid that someone would hack into the system and cause a major problem.
no comment
Technology fails sometimes. Difficult to trust human safety to technology

"If a problem or glitch occured, someone could get hurt. No technology is 100% reliable. Thos could cost someone their life"


The possibility of hacking our staffing information.  And the access may not be as controllable as I would like



i have a close friend who works with this sort of technology security.  through conversations with him i feel less secure with technology.

Hackers seem to be one step ahead of tech companies in general.  If a hacker was good enough to hack big companies like Target and Home Depot payment systems in 2015 then they probably are also good enough to hack my car.
there is already enough tracking of ppl in the USA
ok
For ever good thing computers do someone/people find bad ways to use it. I'm a little afraid of cars safety features getting hacked


Concerns over hacking into my system and making alterations.

too much technology attracts hacking
To many gadgets


bevause of increased stolen vehicles


to easy to hack ito the systems. also they will have glitches will could be deadly

can be too complicated
"I experience numerous issues with the current software in our vehicle.  I.e. slow response, h""hang ups"", need to restart applications.  Cannot imagine a vehicle having full control at this stage of development"
I would need to see it to believe it.
"I understand that some of the new technology is to make OUR lives easier, but what I see is more control over US.  Too much isn't a good thing.  We are loosing OUR rights and don't even see it.  We OUR allowing too many companies and the government to keep taps on us.  I may sound crazy, but it's what I feel and what I think is happening.  We are blinding ourselves from seeing it."
Hackers are always looking to steal a persons information to use for identity theft......a car could be a soft target for these criminals



every device I've ever owned either 'gets confused' or breaks.
It seems that new technology is especially prone to be hacked.

there is no protection anywhere in this digital age so don't worry about it

yikgol

not a human



"Hackers get into everything with a computer.  The more technology you have, the easier to hack."







I just think it's a little scary not having full control of a car your driving. There seems to be too many ways hackers can hack software & I think it's possible they can do this to cars and cause accidents.

additional opportunity for identity theft



still too new
Car could be hacked from outside source.  Too many things to keep track of while driving


Don't trust it
"i am worried that the with more stuff you have more reasons to be distracted, and most driver can not multitask and would put others in danger"

"With any electronic technology, there is always a chance of tampering/and or hacking of its systems."

The manufactures have to prevent hacking and taking control of the vehicle.



"if the technology is down, nothing in the vehicle will work. also, could someone hijack the technology to take control of the car?"


to much hacking going on these days


drivers still need control
"If we don't have any control of car's systems, then someone from foreign countries could control our cars."



DONT THINK IT WOULD BE PROBABLE


no need

I would rather have less technology in control of certain features in my tcar
too many hackers


please..with all the hacking that goes on now...and I enjoy driving
Need more testing on technology
Reports of how easy it is to hack these systems. Security through obscurity is no security at all!




can be jammed

Concern about hacking

As I mentioned before computers programming has bugs and each update has the potential to add more bugs. A human mind though flawed I trust more.


don't trust them
have seen cases of hacking

It is very cool
Whos responsible if it goes off course


Scammers every day breaking different systems
"Have seen programs where car systems can be ""hacked"" and car operations overtaken by outside person."
"With most electronics having the capability to be operated by a smart phone, I would not want someone to have that ability over my vehicle"

"Because we can't keep what we have now safe from hackers and intruders, and your want to let them have greater access to your control.....NOT."





Too much too quickly.
issues have already happened and the more technology we have the greather the risks
It is about time the vehicles can do more in this day and age
you want to make the cars idiot proof and we have enough idiots in this worl. Including our president
I don't understand the question.  I don't believe it has anything to do with the question you just asked.
not proven yet
evil people will always find a way to exploit technology for nefarious purposes


I can see these type of technology is making driving more fun an accident free
You never know how far technology will go.
I hope it turn out great like it being sad

with any technology there is the chance to be hacked

my privacy might not be protected

"Many / most new vehicles today contain electronic components designed decades ago which have not been upgraded to meet modern cyber security standards. Every electronic pathway in / out of a vehicle is vulnerable, from radar scans to keyfob transmissions to satellite radio, and the manufacturers have been rolling this stuff out without much public thought given to the compound security risk the whole package presents. Still low confidence in the makers' security abilities and commitment."
With additional controls will come additional security features....that is the way it has always been.

to feel safe in your car


I believe it's a security issue that's up to the vehicle maker to handle
"There are so many hackers out there and so many ways to hack. Two weeks ago i had my debit card hacked. I have my card but somehow they got the info and went around and paid from my account but used their phone. Im out almost $650 while they investigate. Ironically, when i call my debit card company i have to go through 5 minutes worth of questions to prove who i am but yet someone can swipe their phone at a cash register and dont have to prove anything. I defintely wouldnt trust it witgh my car"

You are somewhat concerned because you did not experience yet
I am concerned about malfunctions causing more harm than the good they may do.

The car's system of operation could be compromised.

you would be nuts to totally trust a vehicle without supervision


It's the future and people need to open up to new technology

VERY GOOD TO HEAR THAT. AND IT'S JUST TIME


to much to go wrong







"could be hacked, may not react fast enough, computer glitches like with anything else"
I want to do my own driving.

alarm system to prevent this problem
A person knowledgeable to technology could steal or car and retrieve all data in the system


some things are great but how safe is autonomous driving really?

"I WOULD NOT RELY TOTALLY ON A COMPUTER OR A MACHINE.  THERE ARE TOO MANY GLITCHES, CRASHES, HACKINGS."
Too much going on its seems distracting

Progress is hard to avoid



it would depend on what is connected to the car

"Too much technology, too many gadgets, too much can go wrong and too expensive to fix."

Error's and technical difficulteys
not sure

"Hacking cars for personal information is handled in a similar manner as online security, the chances of it affecting a large number of people shouldn't be an issue."

getting older if something happened it would take over
people get lax while driivng if car does everything for them.  They need to stay alert at all time.
Technology can be over ridden

Appropriate safeguards always need to be put in place
because nothing is 100 percent as with cell phones and computers and i would be conncerned with this feature in the vehicle that it could get hacked and what if someone else not in the vehicle found a way to control it and cause accidents
Technology can also not work correctly and that concerns me




The system being hacked into
too many things to keep track of


"Like I trust computers?  They can be hacked into, crash and generally unreliable.  I can deal with that at home or office but not on the freeway."


to many things can go wrong it stops for a second or all together

too much room for error
it sounds very interesting.
"integrating things with your iphone, which has all personal information"

Company's can follow your everyday habits to steal personel information.

want secure info





cool

If something goes wrong with the technology it could cause an accident or fatality.  This technology also allows companies and the Gov't to collect information on you.  It's an invasion of privacy.  I would never get trackable equipment installed in my car and if it was I would disable it.
The auto driver would be an invitation to disaster.  All manner of circumstances could prevent the auto driver from functioning properly.

Can be hacked

I don't think it would expose sensitive info. Hacking is why I am not a supporter of self driving cars
I do not own a phone  an avoid technology. I always go for the simplest car. I do not need all the security stuff.

Too many bells and whistles can be expensive.  Driver too complacent and relying on technology.
i am unsure of the on the spot decisions that sometimes humans make and feel that some technologies are not as secure as they appear to be.  I am not totally safe.

Identity theft


"I am worried to much technologies in cars, may cause some harm to the person driving, get caught up in the techonology and not actual looking at the road."

It causes distraction
don't know how efficient it would be and how safe so it could be turned off if necessary
Our computers sometimes do weird things - what would keep these systems doing weird things??

becuase too much technology is not always good it can be a disadvantage

"the more complicated a vehicle gets, the higher the price of the repair bills, becuase not too many people know how to fix it; and should it be fixed by a corrupt auto repair shop, the price to fix their mistakes go even higher. I do not want to add more money to car repairs, if I can help it. I will put up with whatever inconveniences I need to, as long as I can save money. A car is a depreciating asset, and I am not willing to put more money into it."

At this point I don't anticipate excessive hacking into personal cars. However that would be a concern in the future and especially with driver-less vehicles

Too much tecnnology makes a driver less alert and a car too expensive
cannot trust a machine

As in the use of technology in the world there are concerns so too in vehicles!
can break into car and find things on it
live in a safe area without stolen cars

systems can fail


My info is  able to be hacked


Just adding more places hackers can obtain your personal information.

very good

"I would have preferred to answer ""not very concerned"" because, like my phone, I wouldn't enter financial information.

Too much for me to handle






There are just to many to think about in this survey.  There are things that I feel would be better for safety and there are some that are outrageous

"I think that the positives will outweigh any potential negatives.  I'm not one of those ""conspiracy theory"" people that thinks the gov't or some other entity is watching our every move."
"It is just another way to ""leak"" personal information."



"i just dont have security concerns, it could be because i dont fully understand why there would be concerns"


it just sounds scary not being in control!


"Hackers can have a field day with everything that is automated, making it very hard to do anything about it when you are driving"
no one is better than me to drive the car
It is so easy in this day and time to hack in to a database and it worries me that someone could hack into you vehicle and actually cause you to have an accident. If the vehicle was self driving someone could hack it and have the vehicle drive to them.









no reason

deadly tech
Big brother is watching/listening
"too much technology, afraid I wouldn't be able to use any of it or it would disable and I wouldn't be able to use the car at all"

So far any attacks on automated vehicles have been at extremely close rangs and of short duration./

Simply that ut helps drivers and passenger have more safier trips

na
Presently there are a number of recalls on vehicles and this is just another thing that can go wrong.  Not necessary to have.
It is taking away my control.  I would be dependent.
cannot trust human/ me need to be in control

people can become relaible on them and not keep up their driving skills and stay alert it all time while in a car



yes imwatch all my information
don't think about it
People can't drive now. Too many distractions
because machines cant think and assess




I can't imagine the fun those insane hackers would have with all these Wi-Fi connected features.


Loss of control
"In your own words, please explain why you say you are somewhat concerned about the security of additional technology integration in vehicles."
Interferes too much with privacy issues.
To much distraction




Hackers have proven time and again that no system is really secure.  I would not trust the operation of a vehicle that moves at great speeds to a computer system that could be taken over by hostile persons.


hackers gonna hack
na
"Because I watch CSI:Cyber and even though some of the things they had on the show is not possible yet, like people taking over your car while you are driving; if one can think or imagine it, it can happen!"
As technology increases it does not mean that it is the most efficient or convenient way to do things. It also makes the car more likely to be stolen or broken into to get the new technology if it is able to be removed from the car so it could be sold on the street.

I like to be in control of my car

possiblity of someone hacking your system and driving your car or causing problems
credible
concern being hacked
because it to bothersome for the drivers they would always be playing and not paying attention to the road


the more tech we open ourselfs up to means the opportunity for people to hack just that much more


of course I don't fully trust technology to be fully secure at all times...
I feel very safe in my care
it seems to me that this is too new of a concept and not tested for an extended period of time


Hacking will always remain a problem



"afraid of a crash, dummy!"

I trust the technology can do it but it can also break.

Hacking
Tech isn't advanced enough yet
Not sure that this technology is above 80% accurate all the time from reviews I have looked at

New technology means untested and untrustworthy technology. A larger and longer test group and finding/fixing the bugs will make me feel more comfortable n

I want control
Technology can fail too


"Hacking into computerized systems by nefarious individuals has become a real threat to the security of normal people, therefore, vehicle security is threatened by the increased use of technologic advances in automobiles."
The technologies required to integrate could be subject to hacking or compromise.
i would make the vehicle harder to drive
not really sure why

It helps

"I can't control what other people have in this respect, nor would I want to.  In my own vehicle I only use those technologies that I consider safe and appropriate."
What happens when the systems crash? Can this allow tracking of my vehicle?


Almost everything that man invent has problems. This technology in my opinion is not tried & true

someone could hack the system
"Computers work great as well as cell phones, but there are times when they do not.  Technology is great, but not 100 % of the time.  I am not convinced that these technology features will work 100 percent, 100 percent of the time."

good

Adds more things that can malfunction or go wrong with the vehicle.

it needs more research
I wouldn't trust the cars.



it just seems a little risky


Might be worried that someone else could track my movements.



HACKING


Because any system can be hacked.

security is not a problem in this area
I don't like the fact that others will be able to access my vehicle and control it.
"anything digital has access, if I plug or bluetooth my personal devices, now someone can remotely access those devices and have access to my property"
great value
"People are finding ways to take control of a cars technology for no good, until auto manufacturers can insure no one can do this would it be worth it for me."
Don't trust the technology





not needed


hacking >>  driving is a privilege not a right >> besides with all these new features who can afford a new car any



The more vehicles are computer generated the higher the possibility is of hacking the system would become more common.


In my vehicle I'm not but in newer ones yes
I'm not sure.  Security might not be my problem.  it might be reliability.
Nfldn

new world out there



ty ujdjetuj jj





hackers can get into any device  the more devices the more surface you are giving th hackers



i wouldn't use technology if security was at all questionable
anything associated with a computer can be hacked by someone

more stuff to get hacked and go wrong



"I worry that it may be easy to hack into the technology and get my private information such as credit cards, addresses, etc."
I think it would make driving safer for everyone






I lets a person forget what he is supposed to be watching for when he is in a car.
PUES SIEMPRE ESTOY ENTERADO DE LA TENCOLOGIA PARA MEJORAR LA SEGURIDAD DE MI AUTO Y EL PRECIO NO ES LIMITE APRA MI SEGURIDAD

Concerned oabout the abilties of otherrs to hack into it
I am just worried of someone being able to hack and do something bad

None


I would rather rely on my own driving and would not be comfortable in traffic not driving myself
i am a traditional person and i would prefer to drive on my own.  i will be more comfortable



"If the cars system is compromised, it could make it inoperable"

Drivers would get lazy and there is always the chance computer chips or whatever operate the system could go out without any warning.
"As the technology advances and is proven in real time,  I will be more interested.  In the interim, I will continue to monitor."


i don't worry about such things
"Hackers are getting into vehicle software now, and there is not enough knowledge available to the auto mfg. to prevent most hacks."
too much control given to others




I am concerned about the technology malfunctioning and causing an accident.

i think so
unique
"there are too many gadgets, bells, dings and unnecessary add ons in todays cars.  It is annoying and distracting to the driver"



Sndndn ndndndvdjdnd djenen
There seems to be security concerns at all levels of technology.
Things do break down and someone could seriously get hurt and the driver would have to pay not the car manufacture




I like to think and act for myself. I have seen too many machines and computers fail.
the iot is already really easy to hack.  this will not be any different.  kiss.
idk
Some of the new technology removes the driver experience from the vehicle.  I like to drive and am fully aware of my surroundings at all times. I would prefer to drive and handle my vehicle in all situations.

still testing

These options are really leaving the driver with little or no control over anything involving driving.
The car driving it self and not having control scares me

"Without having to do anything.....are drivers susceptible to falling asleep at the wheel.  When you add all these features onto a new vehicle, this has got to be an astronomical price tag on an already $55,000 car.  Tooooooooooooo much."
"I don't understand what is being asked by this question. When I think security, I think of locking my car. Human error can lead to a car unlocked, cars can be programmed to routinely lock."
I would have to see how it applies to others who all ready have this technology
"Every day, computers get hacked.  The servers are in places that shouldn't be hacked (i.e. credit card companies).  How safe from intrusion is this technology?  That is my concern."
just so
Too many cars
"having high advance car,better to keep it safe"
"lots of hackers out there, and new tech will be obsolete if time is taken to fully debug it before it being on the market"

can brake . can cause problems


Who knows what will happen if we let technology take full control over our cars

"Every type of computer system has the ability to be hacked, even highly secured government computers. I can see how a hacker could create havoc and many deaths just by hacking into a car's system and driving into traffic or off a bridge."
Its just capitalism. Give the people as much as they're willing to pay for.

too many places for intrusion of your information
Hackers and government agencies

Have worked with this tech for a long time with no bad results
As long as it functions very well and nobody hurts I will be okay

"I'm always concerned with security, but not particular concerned when it comes to vehicles."
do not trust the technology yet
I feel like technology is a good thing and not something I should be concerned about.



"with all the hacking and various security issues these days, couldn't be more concerned especially with driving"

nothing beats the human
That is a very scary thing to say the least because it's a vehicle and there could be some malfunctions and that would not end well.

Credit cards are being hacked every day by kids     Cars wouldn't be that difficult to do
Don't know enough

too much control
what is their to be concerned about?


Must read reviews first
none
"safety concerns, glitches, circumstantial cases"
"yet another source of access, but this one could potentially kill you!"

don't know how secure it is

too many things around can compromise attention to driving
not sure yet
Don't know enough to be scared or concerned

I just don't like so much personal information being out there

When I see it I'll believe it



not very secret info
xcbzvzcxnvlukqwyeibyvwoe
Too much tv
I don't use vehicle enough to matter

I saw a report today that reliable tech such as this is 10 years away yet
"privacy, more change of government tracking, big brother, government police agencies knowing our ever move."

Possibility of someone hacking and taking over control
I am afraid that it could be hacked and therefore stolen



Some automobiles (Jeep for one) have had their onboard computers hacked.  The more computers in the car the more vulnerable you are.
not safe
Lots of car theft

I know that technologies can have hiccups but people are not foolproof either.

cars can be hacked now
saw it on 60 min and read about it in Consumer Reports...kind of scary what someone could do
it has good quality adn better transitions

remote start and other technologies have been hacked in newer vehicles. afraid this could happen
anything could be hacked and cars have been hacked

All of these additional technologies are unnecessary and they distract the driver from the task at hand.  Driving.
"We have that now in tractors using GPS and row guidance with satellites. Only a fool would not pay attention as though they were actually driving. Ever see a $200,000 grain cart and tractor about to run into your  $500,000 combine because there was a little ""glitch"" in the computer????"


none





it just scary
it may make humans become dependent on all the control the car has & the person becomes less aware of their surroundings and what they are doing.  believe a big distraction & people would be more dependent than independent.

Unwanted or unauthorized access and tracking




Privacy in a word

More things to break probably disabling the vehicle.


Because the thought of someone taking over the controls of my vehicle scares me to death


The more things you have integrated into the system the more chances something may go wrong.

you need human factor in operating a veichle
"I don't really think about it, therefore I'm not concerned about it."
"Are very exposed to hackers, government, insurers and to failure"



The system could be hacked.

Some are too distracting to the driver.  Also adds too much to the price tag of the car.  Plus more things can go wrong and probably expensive to fix
Hackers




The chances of being targeted by malfiesence is very low
The perfect system and roadways are not in place and will not be for many years to come.  We cannot even get the government to keep up maintenance properly on our antiquated roads as they are now
It's just too new of a technology to trust with everything right now.

I think it could be very beneficial in lowering deaths with car accidents



Given the news about who gets hacked and the consequence thereof.

Too much distraction

asdfjl




people text and talk all the time now







Too many options in a car can distract drivers from actually driving.


anything can be accessed


i think additional technology will also include better security also
Human error is bad enough but if something freakish fails technologically it could be a catastrophy

"With so many new, un-affordable distractions,  what's to keep the driver focused on the road?  There is Too much technology.  Either drive; or take a bus."


not really concerned about any security problems

Dodge
The government would have access to these technologies and would use them against me.
"The integration of technology into a vehicle will not provide any more security risk than there already is.  Cyber is cyber, whether in a vehicle or on a phone the internet is as secure as it's users...or should I say misusers."
Your system could be hacked into

just because it might harm
"identity theft, personal information theft, and plain CREEPY"
"The newer the technology, the more concerns that there are."




hackers
well im afraid of being hacked





I the human tries hard not tomake mistake
what if the computer system fails at some point and you are no longer in control

Too much tech is a bad thing
"I just believe or think that with such changes, they'll either be good or bad out of it...it could go both ways, cause a lot of accident me on the road or actually be safer. For now I'm inclining to say, we need it but I don't think we're ready for such technology"

EVIDENCE NOT YET PERSUASIVE
there is no substitute for driver attention



it all takes the drivers eyes off the road
believe technology capable of handling security with continuing evaluation and updates

Hacking is more sophisticated than we think; cars are not as technologically advanced as computers; the consequences of a hack or system failure in a moving failure are severe.
just more avenues for sinister behavior by hackers


I don't know enough about it to discern the implications for concern
I don't trust it.  gps does not always work



"In general, I'm not a first adapter.  I think there are bugs that would need to be worked out tha would only become evident after actual use, not testing."
"As mentioned before, I do not trust most of the newer technology and feel it is too prone to ""hacking"""

Needs to be tested and needs time to make sure there are not hidden problems
Could rely too much on technology when human intelligence may be the best solution.
I don't think its an issue.  We have a lot of technology now like GPS.  so additional technology is not going to make a major difference.

I need to be in control





"move connectivity is more chance for things to be compromised by hackers, etc.  The security tech included in vehicles will have to be proven first."



i think it would bem too easy to track you

Too many distractions. more accidents.
no


Mechanical failure or lack of programming to anticipate the unexpected.
car theft

Computers are not infallible!!! It's enough to worry about identity theft without worrying about it in your automobile as well.

It's more things to break down and cost a lot of money to fix.  Also if something breaks you could be in an accident because you allowed technology to control your driving.  It's not something for me and I think it would be dangerous to have on the road.

Very



The more junk there is the more junk there is to break

"Not tested enough, driving in different cities could be different, how would they know how fast to go or slow, it would work better if all cars where equipped vs 90% not equipped and 10% equipped, going with the flow of traffic 80mph instead of doing the speed limit.  Hackers since the government seems they can't catch.... just like law enforcement can't catch taggers that cost taxpayers a lot to paint over their ""crap"".  Plus all these adds will make it too expensive to purchase."

Not comfortable having a vehicle solely responsible for my children and myself




i feel like to many luxury features and safety conveniences are being put into place that the drivers will become less focused assuming the vehicle will take care of everything.

"privacy, dependency, laziness"

becomes independent of driver


I don't trust the security of technology
great choice
Too  distracting !

"They are nice to have, but they still require your attention and takes from your thoughts on the road.  Human thoughts can't be completely replaced by a computer.  Sometimes judgment has to be used"

people are so consumed by technology that they are less aware of what is going on around them when driving a vehicle.
cause it would be to convient for burglars

"If hackers can break into our military's systems, as they have, then they can most certainly access an automated car."


its all good
don't have much trust in technology


I feel like all of this crap is an added distraction

Working with other people might be a problem as well as the potential interaction with medically/drug compromised individuals.


I trust it


"Because if some of these additional integrated vehicle technologies fail, it could cause massive accidents."

NEED TO BE PROVEN MORE


as it is we are tracked where ever we go why opt in for more indrusions
I would just worry that people could hack into the hardware/software of the car - they can do it on computers so what's to stop them from doing so on a vehicle.

na

because they could be hacked
not tested enough     to many idiots on the road
because things can go wrong.

i have all i need

You are depending on computers  and what happens if it gets hacked or has issues


they  mkght not work well

security is priceless
People will just rely on the technology and not themselves. They may forget how to drive and use technology to do it for them which could be very dangerous.


I'm kind of a happy-go-lucky sort and just don't concern myself with stuff.  I trust technology.




"Any time a vehicle is internet connected it can be exploited by malicious software. This tech will be exploited by persons with political agendas, or other miscreants"

Sometimes too much of a good thing can be a bad thing and could casue consequences down the road.

Backdoor programs

Hackers are everywhere and I wouldn't want to risk someone taking control.
I don't think anyone needs to be doing their electronic banking and driving at the same time. Enough with the gadgets!  These younger kids can barely drive a car now....
I trust future inventions

If people rely on technology too much they will not be able to do things themselves and would lose the ability to reason on the situation and react.


The more features you have the more unreliable a vehicle can be.  But safety features are important
WILL WORK UNTIL CARS BECOMME OLDER.  tECH IS NOT A BAD THING


design by manufacturer would address this potential problem
The more bells and whistles on the car the more thieves will want to steal it.



I just wonder what could happen if the car lost its signal or something.

no need for most. just another thing to go wrong

"Additional technology is not a scary idea, so long as you trust that all the data is not being used against you."



don't trust it. people could access my info.
I think anyone would be concerned until the technology is thoroughly tested and proven.
may be it will hard to take decesio for it just work like mad robot sometime




protect

none
Because it could be just like a machine where anything can happen whether it suppose to or not.  It can always decide it wants to do something else.
needs to be proven




"Like anything new, it will be studied and tested.  I trust that.  I also know nothing is perfect and there will be kinks at first.  It's worthwhile technology to go through that process.  In the long run it will eliminate a lot of accidents, injuries, deaths and damage."

"see too many computer glitches on with things that are far less dangerous, leading me to believe that this would be very dangerous if something goes wrong."
Trust in electronics




as things progress we become reliant on the new features and they become common place.
I WANT TO WAIT UNTIL IT IS PERFECTED


its dangerous
Too much fraud in this world
if I have a self driving car and a hacker cracks the car's computer then I'm at his mercy until I can get to the brake or ignition. I don't trust the maker's ability to harden the system's computer.

trust me more

"With all the recalls with today's cars to make them more complex is pretty stupid, we could build a more reliable car in the 60's without all this technology, just think your car won't start in the 1930's,1940's1960,s parts needed to fix the problem, coil, points, condenser, spark plugs,ingination switch, or maybe a lever action fuel pump, all are low cost easy to replace, and I know all this and I'M A 46 YEAR OLD FEMALE."

first of all you need to concentrating on your driving and not distracted by all this technology.  also I am certain that all this technology will enable everyone to keep track of you and your movements--not to sound too weird but it is true




We are always afraid of the known
The technology would have technicians that may or may not be ethical.

I don't understand it


It could be hacked by a hacker

Cars know too much about us
This world is getting more and more technically advanced and easier for people to break codes and in to computers
na

Too much tech to go wrong
Too many people wouldn't understand it & know how to handle it.

don't think that there are not problems that could occur

adding more technology to devices means there are more vulnerabilities.
imporatant


things could malfunction.



because of safety issues with technology and failing
with todays technology I believe someone else could control your auto even if by accident
"Machines, computers make mistakes.  Relying on things instead of actually driving defensively mistakes would happen more often"

There is always a concern when the internet and your information is out there connected to everything and everywhere!



Rarely in high crime areas - vehicles parked in a garage overnight 99% of the time.
There are very good hackers out there today. Wish you could use their smarts to help instead of threaten security.



"We need more safety, not more potential distractions"

Ease with which others could tap into your driving data and other info through smart phone connection
Lots of testing to ensure it works properly


"cars are more and more controlled by computers--whoever/whatever controls the computer, controls the car--thereby, occupants are completely at the mercy of the controlling entity.  can a car company guarantee hack-proof cars??--I don't think so...."
I want control of the vehicle at all times.

not sure



"Letting a computer judge what's wrong and deciding how to correct can be  a frightful experience. Especially if you are not attentive to the conditions outside the car. When you do become aware of a situation, your knee-jerk reaction could be dangerous. Using cell phones in cars, eating and drinking while driving tend to take one's mind off driving. Will drivers pay less attention to the road in a self driving car just because it is a self driving car."
Too much vehicle theft
With anything computer related there is always a risk of hackers.







I don't have any reason to be concerned
Concerned about having the vehicle hacked and thus losing total control

Others may have access to vehicle

"Car systems can be hacked, can possibly take control of a car or be held for ransom to release car to owner if malware were used"
I prefer my privacy
It is a distraction.
hackers keep getting better
hackers are a real probablem

I know about computer security and hacking abilities. Concerned about ability to secure a commercial commodity like this.




The more you package into a vehicle to more that can go wrong!!!
It just adds a whole new level of issues and concerns to happen
I care about my privacy
Technology could never replace human reactions and is never error proof






The cost of repairs.
there is constant alerts on tv regarding the security of our technology via hacks.  the government is obviously concerned and so am I.

I wonder how secure the system would be to prevent it from being hacked






I presume that there would be privacy measures installed with the technology
Not enough crime statistics on hacking into car technology. Just doesn't seem like it's relevant today. Maybe at some other time it will.






security is not an issue
fddfgdfgfdgfdf
The ability for someone to hack in. And more costly repairs if failed.
technology has glitches

"Obviously, the possibility of having your auto hacked exists and could be dangerous. Also, based on experience with computers, things go wrong and their are inevitable bugs in the system which may be dangerous under some conditions, or create problems in driving or controlling the vehicle."

unauthorized access or viruses that could effect the car or systems





Does not seem like it would be able to adjust to all or any variety of situations. Failure could be tragic.
"the car, just like people can malfunction, but, i would rather have a chance to correct a mistake than to have the car operate on its own"


I dont forsee any security problems with new car technology. Seems easy and safe
Security flaws have already been discovered in numerous systems.
Too much chance of being hacked

DON'T TRUST ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY.



too easy for hackers

easy to acess
"Just like any technology, it could be hacked or compromised and then my info and the car info would be stolen."
It can be hacked and not work properly causing a potential crash and or death.




Just give me a nice 1963 slit window corvette & I'll lock the doors
more technology may involve more drivers to pay less attention to the road
"well, duh"


just somewhat because maybe with drivers that need big brother to be watching it would be good.
Do not think this is a problem
Technology is now available in some cases do not provide all the benefits
much more research needed
I like to be in control of the vehicle that I am driving.

Everything can be hacked are own government computers have been hacked

"The more technology, the more things can go wrong."

just sounds strange sometimes
"Technology always allows a chance for security issues, but I feel they are so rare an occurrence that I do not concern myself with it."



"Too easy to hack. There have been documented incidents where cars have been hacked into, and this is going to become more of a problem. Until something is made hack-proof -- which hasn't happened yet -- these breeches can and will occur."



technolgy is not infallible (neither are humans but an issue of control and decision making exists

"If hackers with malevolent intent can hack the computer systems at the FBI and NSA, it would be child's play for them to mess with the technology in a personal vehicle."



I'VE NOTHING TO KEEP CONFIDENTIAL WHEN I'M IN MY CAR
I think that would be very expensive & I like making my own driving decisions

I don't think it is a major concern. Auto companies can build cars that can't be hacked.



a hacker could shut down your vehicle


the human brain is necessary to assess many confusing situations.  systems are good for rapid response to threats but I'd prefer maintaining some human interaction

ease of  misuse and  hacking
I wouldn't conduct any important business in my car - ever


like to be in control

It's too invasive and open to hackers
dont use it
I have a long way to go before being convinced the technology works without bugs and is safe. This is a computer systems and in my experience all computer systems have bugs that could lead to crashes and injuries.


Have not had enough real world testing of the technology


Security and hacking are on the rise. I do not believe cars can be made absolutely secure from said threats

I don't see the opportunity for a security issue.
I believe that they are safe Im not concerned about it

"I am not a Techie, but I believe there are elements that could disrupt a signal or computerized system."

I don't trust it
all computers fail at times

Its might lose what it is and too much reliance of technolgy
"I will not purchase a car with all this tech. It's a car people, enjoy driving it."
I am concerned that the vehicle's security system could be hacked and my personal information could be retrieved.
hackers

high theft risk
always a possibility that someone could steal information


technology not proven 100% reliable





Because hackers will get access to the vehicle for good or bad reasons.


Not proven over time.
uncle sam already knows so much...where you are...what you are buying...just too much





Will not consider it essential.
I only use technology where I can control the security features
I do not think that the technology has been proven completely safe at this point

There are always opportunities for hackers or technological malfunctions.


I am uncomfortable with the tracking.
"I would have to make sure it would not get hacked, and that it is trulys afe"


technology failure
if it broke down probably create a worse situation

I work in the IT industry and am very aware of cyber terrorism

How reliable are they?

"Computers and their chips fail- when they do, game's over."

hackers are a problem with any wireless technology

na


Don't believe the technology is advanced enough to permit this.
cyber security must be improved significantly for me to place any trust in integrated vehicles
need assurances that it will work 100% of the time

gg




have read articles about how either hackers or even radio transmissions can create major problems

It will be a while before this is ready






"If anything is connected via the Internet, then there is always the possibility of it being hacked."
hacking and confidential information being stolen.
encryption
I think that the ability to hack into a car is over rated.  I work in IT and am somewhat familiar with the technology involved.
technology too easy for people to access others information






It's too early to say so.
I can drive don't need computer doing it for me. computers aren't always reliable
Concerned about privacy.

All technology should be reviewed for any potential problems. Anything can be hacked or fail. It only makes sense to be concerned about security.

Add to many things and it will be more to distract drivers. They are not really need. People should just drive and not use all this technology that is in cars today. Fewer and fewer people are paying attention to the road
it should be controlled by humans. devices always screw up

If something fails it could be catastrophic

If someone programs it a hacker will figure out how to break into the code and do what they want. Very very dangerous.
Hackers have already breached vehicles. No one has demonstrated an absolute secure anything digital so a self driven car concerns me.



"I'm not too concerned with someone hacking into a vehicle security system and causing problems, but I would be concerned with glitches in the system. I know with my computers strange things often happen that I can't explain."
not needed


computers driving the car can't be worse than the current drivers on the road.
too much more to go wrong resulting in recall

none


hackers
I don't see me doing anything in a vehicle that would cause me a problem
"Don't view it as much of a threat to me, personally."



Some can hack anything


"hacking, interference with other systems"
Safety.
"I use very little technology, only GPS sometimes."



tech savvy people hacking

Distraction



"Why give the driver's responsibility over to technology, pay attention and leave technology at home."

I have heard that someone can take control of your vehicle using this technology

Nothing is very secure anymore.  Electronic technology is subject to hacking.

"With all the stuff I have to protect my PC and identity, I can't help but worry about the hack-ability of vehicles.  Alfred E. Newman I ain't."

The government has mandated many of the newer technologies that are now on vehicles. The government should not be allowed to have the amount of control that they have. Although I will never see the day when we get back all the right of the US Constitution





not safe
"Hackers can hack into virtually anything today, and probably into the future. I don't see where a vehicle would be any different. It's scary to think that someone else could take control of the vehicle."
car system hacking
the hacking capability of individuals has significantly improved and I believe that if someone wanted to hack into your vehicle they could do so
Too many distractions
Too much room for error/malfunction.
a lot of exposure to hacking of private information

might be a problem for some
crash
"I learned to drive 45 years ago when such technologies had not yet been invented. I prefer to be in control of the car myself, without unnecessary distractions. However, that being said, I am very concerned that younger drivers would rely too much on such technologies, tend to be easily distracted by numerous technologies within a vehicle, and not pay sufficient attention to controlling the vehicle themselves."


More things to brake




too much going ot to drive safely


I don't know


Cyber hacking could possibly affect reliability over time.



"I feel technology is already pushing into everyone's privacy.  It's a major issue.  No one needs to know about my driving habits, routes, destinations, or where I live."


people know best

The cars system could be hacked and someone could gain control of your car.
computers fail I am a computer tech


It makes it quite easy to steal a car.
not an issue

I have a car because I love to drive.  I do not want to lose that appeat

hacking could be an issue
the general level of insecurity in current software systems




I think it's fine

We have already had examples of vehicle electronics being hacked.  I believe it opens up an owner to huge potential expense to keep updating electronics.  The complexity of electronics in vehicles already makes it very difficult for inexpensive repairs to be done.  No dealership will sell an electronic part and take it back if it does fix the problem.

somewhat concerned just because I don't fully understand them
because of the robots taking over



"Technology integration  in vehicles needs to use computer, It is quite easy to break down. Therefore, it causes a lots of trouble for the driver."





"If computer hackers can get into FBI and other Federal data bases, just how difficult would it be to hack into a vehicle and compromise the integrity of vehicle's system, even to  steal the vehicle. I currently own a vehicle with most of the latest electronic side, back and front warnings and I really think they are important and a great improvement, but electronic security is a joke and do not want my life put at additional risk that way."


to much hacking



Afraid someone could take control of my car
I like to be in control and not rely on technology while I am in control of a vehicle.

there hasn't been enough real life testing done
seems too easy to hack into


Just not sure


With the amount of technology being put into vehicles today the systems have become very complex and therefore are prone to problems.  It is very difficult to find problems as they often times are very difficult to duplicate.
takes away from the classical approach of you are in control of the car...too many distractions

I am not sure if it would work properly.

it would need to prove itself to me
make it easy to be targeted
new technology is scary
"Security concerns are an afterthought, in terms of accessing information within the vehicle(s) computer systems. Additionally, automobiles are VERY vulnerable to hacking due to the weakness of current vehicular computer security."





do not use technology
technology is too new  --  needs to be proven to be reliable

The reports of a an outside source taking over the driving capabilities of my vehicle are concerning.


Increase technology means increased hacking




Potential of having control over your vehicle be taken away by a hacker




Everything connected to the internet or a network can be tampered with.







no good
"Nothing is secure anymore, companies already track my websites to create better advertisements for me, I don't want anything tracking where I am whenever I drive"








no  facts
hackers
its not viable yet
"already demonstrated abilty to hack into vehicles, this vulnerabilty will only grow"

every day the news is about something being hacked.  3 different TV shows this year  has a hacked car system as a plot part


Computers aren't infallible.
"Hacking, General loss of control aND responsibilities"

There are currently far to many gadgets in autos that are targets of thieves and provide distractions to drivers.

"added technology offers more distractions for drivers, increases the cost of the vehicle, are likely to increase maintenance costs and may be open to security breaches"
Technology can fail all the time. Machines can never replace human touch / judgement.

"I have no secrets when communicating, which is done in emergency situations only."
There could be a breakdown of the system thus causing a disaster
It can be hacked into and even possibly cause accidents
"I would be a ""follower"" in this type of technology."
"It depends on the technology you are talking about.  Too much technology means there are too many things which can go haywire.  While there is plenty that can go wrong with humans operating the vehicle, I am reluctant to cede too much control when driving to technology I do not know how to c.ontrol"

hackers and relibability.

The market will see that this stuff is safe

it would be broken every other day

many reasons
I am worried someone can get my information
I think its possible the system could be hacked.




Too much stuff that can go wrong.  All of these things give drivers a sense of invincibility; they relax their concentration and forget that their principal function in the car is to drive it and pay attention to what's going on around them.
na

computer hacking
don't want the responsibility
Too much technology!



see no benefit and cost



I can't think of a scenario that is harmful
more for thieves to take
Just too scarey to think of this option
"If it fails, i am responsible, and i am old enough that i am quite used to doing things the old way."


too much tech that someone could actually hack into
Computers have bugs and can be hacked.  How does driver regain control in case of malfunction?
I am quite comfortable with my ability to handle my own vehicle








I feel I have great responsibility in this and take care at all times to do right
I don't see where the security of this technology could pose a threat to me.

Just don't think it is practical
Too many people out there that can hack into things and cause problems


don't like the idea


I feel the technology is automotive not security related.


people need to control their own cars


k;ji;gu
no trust
Increased technology = increased glitches
possible hacking

technology can be hacked
"no technology is completely secure, bad guys will understand it much beter than I"

just seems like more things could go wrong.  you could be dependent on the technology and it might quit working.  too much room for error.



it's too easy for skilled and experienced hackers to find a way to get into the system





I like to feel in control of my vehicle
"Technology has the ability to glitch in certain aspects, and when technology glitches in your computer or phone a life is not at risk, as it is in a vehicle situation."

"The car is there as a transportation device.  Half of these things would be more distractions that a driver really doesn't need.  Cooled second row seats is a good thing - makes people comfortable, pay once and it's done, and there's nothing distracting about it for the driver."

GOOD I LIKE BEST

it is needbased


numbers

It's something I just don't really think about.
I am not comfortable with this technology unless every other driver has the same technology.  A computer cannot anticipate other drivers who do not use the same platform.

good
"It depends on what aspects of technology you are talking about. Cell phones, one form of technology, whether hand held of hands free, disturb a driver's concentration on driving. So that's a concern. I find a system in some expensive cars where the cruise control slows you down behind a slower vehicle in front is a real nuisance when you want to overtake that slower vehicle, because you cannot get close enough to pass it easily. But technology like self driving cars will be well tested and safe"


too many distractions


too new

people may become too complacent and when they do have to be in control may no tpay attention

"There are too many things that can happen outside of its control , not safe enough for me"


being hacked
The ability of hacking and rearranging
Could provide a distraction for already distracted drivers and not sure the technology is fail-safe.



no computer can replicate a human




all computers connected to the internet are subject to being hacked

Sometimes it may get failed to operate or perform in middle of something which may lead to severe disaster.

would the driver be paying ANY attention to driving?


no need

recent security problems at gas stations etc with credit cards and viruses on computers. Would need good security programs to be useful.

NICE

As an older person adapting to that change would seem a bit Jetson like and would take some time getting used to this ability
Not enough evidence of safety of these options

offer the latest in car security technology

I just don't trust it
"People hack into your computers now, not sure what they could do if have same options in a vehicle"


njkhijgo
not sure
Government knows to much about me already
"Technology is great, but what happens to people when it breaks ?"


great


I like having the control

it has to be tested for a least 5 years before I get it



not sure
"More risk of identity theft, etc."
Allowing the driver to be less in control of the vehicle will give some drivers tacit permission to multitask behind the wheel. These technologies would have to develop some ability to force the driver to perform behaviors on a random basis to ensure that they were not doing something else while supposedly driving. And there is the issue of driving for work -- how many companies would lean on workers to be doing other tasks behind the wheel? Could the technology be hacked into?
Does this make it possible for cars to be hacked?
there is always the threat of being hacked in your own car
hackers will respond to the challenge



do not trust total computer
"Not for myself but for others who blatantly text, talk, etc."


as with any technology i have concerns about hacking
gfghfc fyfhvh

HIGH CONFUSION RATE




too much control to others. feel need a human


trust new technology
"Just read an article in Road & Track about an Audi that is self-driving, and while it seemed safe, some things about it made me doubtful.  It needs more testing."

not up to date on all the new things available
Vehicle manufacturers are well aware of the problems of security with technology integration and are taking appropriate steps to maintain security.

People are already distracted in their vehicles. It concerns me that they will get even worse as more distractions are added. I think we need self-driving cars SOON.


ok
all electronics have flaws
"...more options, more problems"

"over electronic control would be to expensive with no reliability ,prone to outside control of vehicle"
"I like to be in control,"

"additional technology means more expenses when something breaks, but it worries me about the chances of someone hacking a system like that and causing worse damage"
"I just don't believe it's a big problem, and don't think it will be in the future."


Think the threat is minimal
"While these technologies are for the safety of vehicle operators, our lives are becoming increasingly invaded with these views into our lives."
security is not a high priority for car manufactures.

TECHNOLOGY IS ALWAYS AHEAD OF THE GUIDELINES & RULES FOR ABUSING THE SYSTEM CAPABIITIES
Too many ways for these technologies to be hacked into
my driving ability
cars are man-made and therefore subject to failure - what happens on the road when these cars fail.
My age!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




"Like with any computer, there is the potential for the car to be hacked rendering the driver incapable of controlling the vehicle.  in addition, the more technology, the more that can go wrong with the vehicle and lead to costly repairs."

"From design to integration into the vehicle the tech has been known for several months or years, so it is vulnerable to hacking. Tech can't keep up with hackers."

gfdg

Systems can fail or operate ineffectively.  Putting my trust in something like that would be foolish.
what about failure of it
"Mostly due to the possibility of government snooping into my driving preferences and the attendant possibility that government  would use that information to tax my behavior, probably from a ""do-good; feel-good"" or falty environmental concerns."
too likely a chance for malfunctions or electronic failures
would want it tested before it came to market
not sure



I THINK THEY AREA GOOD IDEA BUT THEY STILL NEED A LOT OF TESTING.
I live and drive in Manhattan and around New York City.  These technologies will not be safe in a dense urban environment without enormous modification to the infrastructure to support them.  We will not see this happen.



this world is so crazy that anything is possible


"Too many mistakes are made with technology. Just slight battery disfunctions cause the car to be undrivable. Too many hackers, people who would love to take control of anything you own that is electronic."
Too far out there
"Additional techonology I think oppose a threat to other breaking into you car, what ever happen to just keeping things simple"

accidents are on the driver and if you were not in control of your vehicle does that mean you are at fault??

"they want to steel your car more for all the expensive ad on things in your car,"
Dont know how safe it would be.


hacking
the manufacturers should make it safe for us


too easy to hack systems and take control of vehicle


"More technology, more vulnerability"
too much
How would you know that these things are working properly?  Too much technology!

protection


I don't see it as a problem.


"Technology based updates need system/software updates, they can crash and fail"
there is always breaches of computer systems


Security
"We have enough issues with drivers not paying attention to driving and until we sort out those problems, i.e. making texting/talking on a handheld device, illegal nationwide, AND enforce those laws, new technology is another distraction that at this point has no control point for usage"
Hackers seem to be able get into any system so I'll stick to manual control thank you

Potential for hacking.







Currently there is no effective security in this space.
too many distractions and less eyes on the road
hackers could invade
confidence in the technology
"I do not allow access via my phone to important sites.  In this case, I guess I am concerned and this is why I do not use these features."
robot

Security with all technology makes me nervous. I believe that all consumers need to be aware of the safety of their information and how it's being processed.
expensive items cause more theft

"The risks are generally known and providers will work to stay in front of the security challenges.  I do have some concerns, however I would still absolutely seek to buy tech-integrated vehicle"

"Too easy to hack, law enforcement and rogue employees already have remote control capability of some systems via internet or satellite."

"On my current vehicle they are a valuable asset, not something to ""fear"""

Afraid that someone could take over driving my vehicle.
Technology can be a great asset when working properly...but technology sometimes fails.

Things can go wrong


live in a area not needed
to mush information vernarible to outside forces.

People will find a way to hack it.
"The more information that is captured by the car, the greater risk of hackers getting it"

"not interested at this time, may change my mind when the time comes."

someone may hack into software and get sensitive information
"technology has become such an important part of life and many people use such things as smartphone to perform so many personal actions and then there are the hackers, its just an issue that is becoming an increasingly tough thing to control"




technology fails from time to time. At 60 MPH the potential for serious death and injury is unbelievable. Also concerned about hacking and taking over a vehicle.
no reason comes to mind - just no anxiety in that area right now


someone will cut out eye or finger to use your car.  Car full of drunks or addicts or thieves having a getaway car do the driving for them.  Socialistic useage of car with dregs of society. NO THANK YOU!





Too new at this time
I would be afraid that some technological problem might develop.



Distracts driver
"not all people are honest, vandals and thieves would love this junk at  my expence"

"With the ability to provide remote access between wi-fi enhancements and technical mobility, how long would it take for a criminal to gain access to and take over the vehicle?"

conmmon sense

"Because you are not operating on a ""closed,"" fixed wifi network. anyone with computers savy can and probably could enter your car where as enhanced tech. would make it even MORE tempting to steal it or use it through their OWN tech. invasion bypass to acquire your equipment might make it more appealing"
"The more sophisticated cars become, the more prone they are to security problems."



What happens if the computer goes belly up when its in control... I would rather be in control.



equipment failure


Too many glitches can happen - and too many hackers out there in the world.
can the technology be hacked
I think we are overconcerned about it
would prefer to be in control

"dangerous, malfunctions"

too easy too hack into the system
too many devices.
I was in technology industry from 1072 to recent. Think I know enough to keep important info segregated from public access

Don't know. Just not trusting technology to work all the time. Computers run too many things.
Just like any of our technology information can be gotten from it.
not sure if they are safe enough

privacy

theft


Hackers could hack into the system and take control of the vehicle
would have to be proven after years of use
Ive ridden in an autonomous vehicle and it will pull you back into a pothole or dead animal on the road. The technogy is not good enough yet.
"Although technology is getting more reliable it still lacks a sufficient level of reliability for me to trust it for something like driving.  Still seems too easy for hackers to break into these types of systems and I do not see any benefit to having this type of technology, especially when you consider the cost, security and reliability issues."
some cases have been reported that the car can be remotely controlled.... shutting off the engine or increasing speed
because it could cause risk to other passengers

computers aren't perfect and/or designer would screw up






it's needed and they should have everything all figured out prior to implementing.

people are important

some things just need to be managed by humans





These systems are too new and untested for me to trust them to work 100% of the time
Could cause lots of damage if it malfunctions.



I don't feel auto companies are putting in the safeguards in place to prevent hacking and overriding of vehicles

"The more complicated things, are the more likely it is that things can go wrong."

Makes a driver less aware



What if something fails?


seen stories of someone controlling the vehicle via the internet connection of the car.




Just a feeling I have.
because  I just don't trust the government.
it seems a little too technologically advanced.  I'd like to have complete control of my vehicle.

being hacked


Would not know if I could fully trust the technology when I know I could things myself
someone hacking into the technology and creating major problems

How easily it can be hacked.  Expense of keeping and maintaining.
"Big Brother already controls enough of our lives, so tell him to kiss off!!!"





Hackers can get into your car system and disrupt driving

It would make driving more enjoyable and the possibility of extra chances of security would be better for all in the long wrong.

Old school.I like to be in control

There have been navigation and other bluetooth systems that have already been hacked.


Technology increases chances of someone else being able to take over your vehicle and make it do what they want it to do.  I'm too old for that nonsense.






anything can be hacked

Need to see if it works.

do not want my vehicle to be hacked


du du du ud dud ud


I do not see any danger involved.


eryseyhe5uysuhe5uh

Opens up doors for hackers. There is always some crazy person out there.


distractions cause accidents
I think nothing can replace a human


To much distraction


"Every day we hear of hacks into technology, and vehicle technology is probably no different."




Balance between increasing safety and efficiency and too much monitoring of personal behavior.

abuse of system by others using it.

Current car technology has grossly inadequate security - with a more technologically advanced fleet of cars the US will face greater treats of malicious hacking. This is particularly concerning for features involved in driving and safety.
hackers can take over the car


Could lead to increased theft of the vehicle or contents due to hacking.  Privacy issues - I don't necessarily want marketers or law enforcement agencies knowing my driving habits and destinations.  Safety issues - It seems to me these systems would only work if all vehicles are automated.  A mix of manually driven and automated vehicles could be very unpredictable and unsafe.
"Not sure I would trust some of this technology - how it would react to situations, other drivers, etc.   Also would want to know how insurance considers self drive technology."


Recalls...Glitches...Hydroplaning...

not concerned about hackers into my car
"I think all the added technology makes it easier to get personal information, leaving us more open to fraud through hacking"


Hackers gaining access to the vehicle and other information.
Given the number of computer geniuses there are out there these technologies would be easy to hack into and it would be frightening to be in that vehicle should it happen. i would not consider any of these technologies w/o some failsafe that would allow me to revert back to manual should a situation like this arise.

just one more item someone else might get control of

smart  people  can  hack  into  the   best  equip  and why  risk  when  don't  need  too
great for my car
It seems like there is a large risk of being hacked or a failure of the system.




the idea of being hacked while the car is moving sounds dangerous

The technology integration would have the same systems of security as a computer so I would be no more concerned using this than my personal computer.

dk
"I am a great fan of new technology. However, backups should systems I am more concerned about this."
"I love the idea, and I love the possibilities.  But I worry about the potential for misuse.  It's great to have a car run automatically, but if it malfunctions, or it is maliciously compromised what can be done?  It would be great for Police to be able to locate, and shut down a stolen, or dangerous car, but what keeps bad guys from doing the same?"


"There are just no way to plug all the holes of human error in creating technology.  Someone, somehow, some way will hack into it and mess with it, or there will be a bug that makes it malfunction at a time unknown, etc.  Technology is nice, but not perfect.  Too much reliance on it is dangerous."

Too many computer/wireless additions

This is important for a driver

I wouldnt use most of the new technology out there and I guess I would be a little concerned if cars are going to do the driving instead of real people

I do not want the possibility of other obtaining information about me or my auto
too easy to hack and more things to go wrong

no

the more equipment the more crooks can get into
"technology cannot be prepared for every eventuality in the world and cannot reason like a human.  also, i feel it would lead to more people who are impaired to feel they are safe to be on the road and endanger more lives"
It is human made and could make mistakes or fail conpletely

still need the driver in control
too many variables that cannot be controlled; i have seen and heard the simple warning devices in my car give false positives to the same obstructions some days and not on others.  so i disregard the device
"If a car is going to drive me, I want the ability to take over if there's a major malfunction or if I feel like driving for the day."





I just don't worry about things like that.

Need to see that self-driving vehicles have been proven over time and in numerous circumstances.  What happens if/when the technology fails?







I don't think I have anything to be concerned about

"errors, bugs"



"It can't comprehend and respond accordingly to all possible situations,esp weather"





"hacking the vehicles computer, reliability of system"
Loss of my identity.

"The more complicated the technology, the more chance of failure."



"While it eliminates the ""human"" error factor, which might be good, I am not comfortable with technology taking over my life"

"For one thing, they are distractions. There is nothing like an LED screen popping to life to grabbing your attention to warn you that you're about to enter a dangerous situation. Now you're looking at the screen instead of the road. Bad. Also, hacking dangers aside, this teaches complacency to drivers who may otherwise have good skills and baby those who don't. It encouraged bad habits and worse, allows good habits to atrophy. If you can't merge without a video walkthrough, PLEASE do not drive."
hackers being able to disable intentionally or accidentally


I saw a demo and it ran over the demonstrator.  That was probably an anomaly but showed what can go wrong.



don't need the Terminators of Cyberdyne Systems driving our cars.

my imput

"Because it's still an uproven technology with likely bugs to be worked out.  Until such time, I'd be concerned in paying for them and using them."
I like to be in control.
"I trust many other forms of technology with my private info already, I trust they can create a safe system"
"The more we use technology in vehicles, the more we are opening ourselves up to fraud."

Could give a false sense of security and actually lead to more accidents
To many instances of hacking.
I worry about people controling my vehicle in a way I would be unhappy with
ldont know much about it and not sure how safe it really is
"I have already had my indentidy stolen once, the chinese are stealing everything from our government are you kidding me"
New technologies are not always reliable as planned
computers can go offline
other features
"If I were being driven by a semi-autonomous vehicle and the this vehicles electronics were hacked while driving, my life and the lives of those within the car would be at serious risk."
Testing cannot account for all conditions.  Failure and accidents are inevitable.  Too much risk.


Intrudes on personal privacy.
just want to feel safe

even technology makes mistakes
in all has god amount of things to choose from
"Particularly with smart phone pairing since all of my personal information is on my phone now. I think the car would be less secure and put that information at risk. Also, if hackers can see that my car is not home, they can assume I am not either and my house would be vulnerable to burglary"

"ore distraction. Have read about fighter pilots and their issues in jets. A lot of this technology is helpful to someone like me but I worry about much younger drivers letting the tech take over and still getting into accidents bec they don't use their common sense or they're watching videos, etc."
If the technology fails it could cause a serious accident



I am concerned about the security of devices which might make personal information available to others.

I worry about others being able to access the technology from outside.
I don't trust a computer to drive me around - like all technology there are glitches and that would be too much of a risk



I could use the help



"I hear so much these days about hacking, so that raises concerns."



I want to maintain control of my vehicle

I know they would never put out a car that hasn't been tested repeatedly or get sued.


none
mot dependable enough yet
"Electronics are always going wrong, especially when first come out not safe"

"distracted drivers, leads to accidents and the more you do in your vehicle the more you open yourself up to security risks"
depends on the situation. computer may be great at calculating and driving to meet the needs but there is human nature of driving that may prevent the enjoyment and hacking would ruin the luxury




i dont want someone to steal my vehicle

we just haave to be very careful about givn g out information
No particular reason




Not actually concerned.......i like to drive and feel the automobile when i am behind the wheel
"a computerized system can go on the fritz or have issues, bugs..even a virus could possibly be downloaded via satellite, machines and programs are not infallible"
sdfsdf
asdasd

present another venue for people wanting a challenge to disrupt average people
safety

I've yet to see the technology proven enough to trust it.
i don't think it is an issue


Not easy to fix when the system is faulty.



"Do not want to rely on this technology - it's too new, unproven and would potentially ruin my driving experience (which, by the way, I enjoy)."
Because its not an actually person driving

Concern that someone might be able to hack in and take control of my car.
the other older cars
"its okay if the car is on a track like a train, but cars do not have that luxury"
Concerned with all areas of technology.
It's becoming too much of a digital world

what if something malfunctions? i still trust the human brain more

none

hackers
I don't use that much technology in my car.
I don't want the option of someone hacking into my system or creating an option for identity thieft.
just encourages people to be even more inattentive
how many passwords and other security devices are required?  Especially with the power of self driving coming on.
hackers



don'tknow
too much going on allowing a computer to do what the driver is suppose to
not human

more avenues for hacking
don't want to rely totally on a vehicle stopping prior to accident -+





I am concerned that with more technology  it would be easier to hack into a vehicle and control it.

only some are required


"systems might be hacked, could lead to crashes.  Also have serious privacy concerns"


n/a
na







People will get too lazy and never pay attention. What if something goes wrong? I hope my family is not involved!


concerned about privacy
Technology integration can become a risk when connectivity is lost.

"I would be concerned about the reliability of this equipment, plus the additional cost it would add to the overall price of the vehicle"
too much technology. unnecessary



It's already been shown that these systems can be hacked. I don't want someone else taking over a car's systems.


Concerned that the car computer could be hacked and either taken control or done damage



I value my privacy.
who would be responsible if vehicle is involved in an accident?  the car?
"No data is every 100% secure. Don't know what you would do with the data, don't know who could access it and what they would do with it."


Too much room for error!
no human element
don't like not being in control

"More opportunities for parts failures, and government hacking."




I guess trusting that these technologies would have safeguards built into them
big brother and hackers
just too much technology

I'm concerned that an internet hacker could gain control of my vehicle and cause it to stall or crash in traffic.

This issue does not concern me.

While the concept seems reasonable it seems to be cost prohibitive





The new technologies make a vehicle safer to drive ... and a lot more fun.
I have little or no interest in autos with lots of technology.  I only drive locally &  a few thousand miles per year.

I don't know what information I'm putting out



I just am not concerned.
nothing is fail proof
not completely confident




"A lot of personal information can be stored in the car and I wouldn't want it hacked. Furthermore, with all the electronic control, you could get hacked and have something disabled while you are driving."
"I think that all of this technology is taking driver's away from concentrating on the road and more relying on the devices to take care of things. It gives them even more incentive to text and drive, which is as bad as drunk driving. or be doing something else besides concentrating on the road.This is not a good thing. I also think that cyber security is also a GIGANTIC issue with technology included in cars."
Unknown







"nor a big issue for me, it is just a car"
don't need this




I do not think there is enough information on this system yet




Criminals are very good these days at using technology to their advantage.





Not ready for this

"If they can hack a computer, they can mess with your cars computer and change your driving security. We rely on computers for way too much."


technology is moving too fast
Too many electrical issues to go wrong; hacking; etc.
Technology fails at times.
"Any system can be accessed by the right party for good or bad.  However, limited use of technology that controls vehicle movement would be desirable, as long as it can be over-ridden by using a switch or brake."
As with all technology the way to hack the system would be there.
hacking is already a big enough problem


it needs time to become reliable
technology doesn't always work
Needs more time and trials

no reason

n/a


Hackers are becoming more efficient everyday



I'm always concerned with the security and with all the new technology now days and how thief's get around it I would be very concerned
I have had a car with all the bells and whistles and when they start to go the whole car won't function


NA

"As more technology is added, it seems hackers are more able to get into vehicles or control them. I don't want someone to be able to get into my car because they read the signal off my key fob or control the moving vehicle through my computer system."
"people are too stupid and to constantly rely on technology instead of skill and common sense is a recipe for disaster, especially when self-involved teenagers and millenials are included in the mix"


TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY IS NOT GOOD

all technology can be broken



Big Brother

malfunctions and potential issues




There are too many things that are operated with technology and the worry is that technology can be hacked
all of this concerns me
very good
potential for hackers
Needs to be tested more before I would feel comfortable with the security of additional technology integration in vehicles.

"Every bit of technology offers the opportunity for vehicle disabling and hacking, ad increased purchase and repair costs."


I just don't worry about that stuff
I am concerned about the risk that security flaws might allow a third party to access the vehicle's computer system.
drivers can become distracted. a lot of data would be collected about me

saw the video where the driverless car hit a person. all can be hacked
the cost



i see how wrong and complicated computers can be


Frequent stories in the news tell of hackers increasingly getting control of supposedly secure systems.

not proven to be safe



"I've seen TV episodes where people hack into a drivers car.  Plus, you would be leaving the safety of your family in the control of a fallible system."

there are too many variables in diving to rely on some tech weenie's ability to program for them all
There seems to be a real potential for hacking into a car's computer
"ability to assess road conditions, unforeseen movements/impediments"
just not comfortable with the idea


the ability for someone to hack into vechile and take control of functions
the safety of allowing the car to go without a driver is somewhat difficult to comprehend.  What happens if the car hit another car?  Who is responsible?



idk

"Mechanics can fail, human is better"
can always be hacked
hacking is always concerning no matter what
don't trust that it would function correctly 100% of the time
There are always numerous security breaches happening with banks and credit cards. Technology is not hacker proof.

because hackers can hack into anything these days






i don't really give it too much thought
Still a very new technology for aotomotives and with constant fear of hackers need reassurance that technology is safe to use.

depends on the complexity of the task that it will take over




A computer cannot make certain judgement calls. It is difficult enough for us humans to make them and not have dire consequences!

because I would be worried someone could hack into your car and mess with it so you could crash.

"When it is proven that the technology can be hacked and us harmed because of it, then I will become more concerned!"

i like it

easily hacked

concerned more about another driver not paying attention


Data is available to others

It's expensive and people are putting their lives on the line for technology that can go bad at any time
I just want to know it safe put all of those technology put in the car.
"if a vehicle can do all this on its own, it can ""run away"" from me or be hijacked very easily by a tech savy person"
not enough brain/person control


good
whats the point dudes
i have teenage drivers.  too many people distraced on phones
Concerned about privacy and safety. Government or other organizations would try to use the available data for ends that do not benefit me. Criminals would attempt to use the technology to disable the vehicle for ransom or robbery.

hackers can get involved easily
its a very interesting concept makes driving easier
ghfty gfbfh ghhgh ghghghc
no

"reliability, safety,its a machine what if it mis calculates"
good value


for it would be very useful but on the other hand would be a great distraction for drivers because they are distracted watching your mobile or configuring applications
I think it will be addressed just as other electronic security vulnerabilities have been




The vehicles computer can be hacked and can cause accidents and injury. Your personal information is also subject to hacking.
"I haven't seen it, so I don't know."

"Duh? I'm worried about the other guy, not me. So now it's what not even a person???"

Because I don't plan on using it.

h klk;j ghg jghjkh ;kljljkhlkj
People can always hack into new technology for criminal purposes.


simple is better
Problems with hacking.

Whether they are perfectly fit with the vehicle or not.
Concerned someone will hack into the car & start driving  me into a wall
"it's a problem now, it's only going to get worse"
drivers become less attentive

dangerous
no
I couldn't care less.  I am a car guy and a DRIVER!!!  Cars are a lot more than washing machines that just get you from one place to another!

Too much technology.
too many things to give chance to hacking

I'm not sure how it would work with some vehicles equipped and others not.
"a lot of technology can be hacked and I would be worried about hackers accessing a cars computer and shut the car down or kill the brakes, etc."


Everyone has phones anyhow




what happens when the cars decide we are no longer necessary
Do not trust the technology of the car being able to drive itself.

security is more important

Afraid it could be hacked


Hackers






i am always concerned about the security

there are a lot of worries about people being able to tap into the security system of the vehicle and the system being compromised
There is not that much personal or relevant information that could be hacked.



Whatever happens will happen
I think most of the tech would help people better drivers.
Too many distractions for young drivers.
good
still old school useless tech

"Would just seem like a hassle to hack, but who knows"

nothing


I think that there will be testing done to see how secure or insecure the new features are and then I as a consumer can decide if I want that feature on a vehicle or not.


im not concerned about this
not very concerned beacuse the product are really cool to work with

It's very useful to avoid many mistakes
system hacked and compromise the safety of the car



hackers can take control of the vehicle
Makes car pricier. Also need human input. Too much makes drivers less focused

"I am not very concerned, I do not know how well it could be trusted!!  It would make things nice, especially with screaming and yelling and crying children whom need your attention and you are unable to pull over.  You would really half to be convinced this technology could be reliable and safe, along with affordability."

I think a human must be driving.  I feel that it is more of a danger having these robot cars.
More things to go wrong
Someone could hack in and drive your car






"I would be afraid  it would shut down  ,or I would be locked in and not in control of vehicle ."
all tech is not always secure

"I work in the IT field, and I know how easy it can be for people to hack into systems. What happens if someone has it out for me or the make of the car I'm in or the location I am in and wants to do damage? Also, what about national or international terrorists--- do we have enough security and enough backup features to protect us against such things?"
don't hear much about a problem

I like to be in control. Car could be hacked as well!

better to trust my skills

more things to go wrong and also the possibility of someone else hacking it
improved safety is worth it
why drive
not sure



MAJOR KEY!

I'm not sure to what kind of vehicles you are referring. I believe it would be impossible to use vehicles that doesn't require driver in regular traffic nowadays.
good

it is just too new to protect
have no idea
too much tech.
w232`
n/a


because the security tends to be difficult if there is any mistake or the code is forgotten it takes time before one can retrieve it



I think too much technology available in a vehicle can be distracting.

"If something happens to the computer their is no way it can be control by hand, cause it was computer controlled"





it's very importent

"Hey man you got a new phone, and the rest. the more you know that the company is the most part, I have everything we can get the most part, I have everything we can get."

can be weird  not knowing



I don't know enough about it





"People cant drive as it is now, add all these new technologies for them to deal with qhile driving and we are in big, big teouble!"

yes
Don't want my identity stolen.


I'd b turning over my control
uranus
after teaching many other people to drive I think it's best  if a person learns how to operate a car without all the help
ok
I'm concerned about security and liability issues
We have enough technology
Car the are completely computerized have the ability to be hacked. There are people that would try to do this for their own pleasure while risking the safety of whoever is in the vehicle. I'm not comfortable with the possibility of losing complete control.


I like the idea


"Hopefully, automakers will use encryption and firewalls to increase the security of additional technology."
People get too distracted already

rerererere



Robbers





driver should have more control over the vehicle

Security is high with luxury


It's like anything else with technology you have your risks but most of the time the benefits outweigh the risks


It's a matter of control.  It's like a computer with a glitch or a virus. Malfunction seems inevitable.
aaaaaaaaaaa
It would just take trial runs to make me feel safe. It would take some getting use to
Hacking the systems could cause serious problems. Reliability needs to be proven.

Hgbjhj

Sounds like it could've scary
I need whatch more about it on tv



Because of hacking

There are a lot of bad drivers out there and I don't trust technology to be able to compensate for it.
"Make car more expensive, not proven, cant contol computer settings such as speed"
Paying attention is still the safest way to drive


My vehicle would likely a target for break-in and theft

I trust technology and I think it would help with safety issues





I think to much technology in a vehicle the driver isn't going to pay attention and just trust the car to take care of everything

to much technology causes more accidents
ertergdf

not less secure than everything else

More vulnerabilities like hackers or government snooping


security features can be hacked hence my concern
it all depends on what kinds of technologies the car will have.


I think it will be tested and certified to be safe before hitting the market.



Responsibility for malfunction


It might provide too much of a distraction for some drivers.
possibility they hack to your personal information
its still good to have a human driver

They help make the roads safer
explain
very good
appealing
Too many people are distracted drivers now.  Additional technology can increase this even more.  Distracted driving is the highest cause of accidents already.  Features need to be designed to use when the vehicle is stopped or parked to reduce issues with technology and distracted driving
Money is being wasted rather than to FEED DYING CHILDREN IN STARVING COUNTRIES HELLO?


i'm just not concerned.

Na
I believe that people would come to rely on the technology to too great an extent and lose focus.  There is always the possibility of malfunction of technology.
"From what I've seen from technology in general, I'm not convinced that it has yet progressed far enough for me to put my life in it's hands. I would feel more secure if it could easily be overridden at any time. Also, I do not approve of any technology that invades privacy or restricts free will."

IT IS FID

People can hack into it and cause you to wreck and that is a scary thought.

Hacking is a major issue and the more computers being used and the more advanced the tech the better the hackers get.
To many hackers







don't need it
DONT  TRUST

Doesn't matter

It would make me wonder if it could ever fail and cause me to get in an accident





Makes life easier

personal security



It is to early
Hackers are very good at what they do.
Unsure


people can break in with the use of  technology

Car problem distraction computer fails

too much extra makes things go wrong - break down

It could be hack


"I don't have anything I need to worry about.  I'm mostly social with some banking ability, but I don't have anything work related on my phone, hence my car"
Databases would need daily accurate updates.

Any computer can be hacked

"Technology is the wave of the future.  With that comes the threat of security, but I feel confident in the knowledge and advancement to protect ourselves from security breaches"

"Well we have all seen the movies terminator and maximum overdrive, those alone are frightening. But the way cars and technology break all the time, is it really worth your life to be lazy? I like to be in control."

"I think that while technology is a great thing, it has also proven to be inefficient and potentially dangerous over time. I am however, willing to take such a risk."

none.

often too much technology is harmful when it fails









it would not be introduced if it were a bad idea


Well too much technology integration is dangerous. You don't know all the risks yet. Who can hack it?
Afraid of what could go wrong snd hoe costly
because i think is a really important topic nowadays


Systems are too easy to hack. Have seen it in youtube videos.
ok
I simply don't like the idea of these technologies. I will only rely on myself.
You have the potential of someone breaching the system.



because intergration allows for infiltration

I just don't like not being in control
Na
It can be easy to hack.
I am concerned about all new technology
I need to have control

Too much technology makes the vecihle more likely to be stolen or car jacked
I don't know


"The technology might malfunction, and that would be a major safety hazard."





I follow tech pretty close and have read extensively on the safety and truly believe that humans are the issue when it comes to accidents



Its sll good

I will be concerned for my safety

Because we do no know what they are putting In our cars
Cracking the system is always possible


"I feel like if technology were to take over, and we'd all be extremely lazy and relying on technology all the time. What if there's an error? Or a hacker? Who allows a lot of car accidents to happen out of spite."

i will need it
Cars could be hacked and you wouldn't have any control over them.

"Im not too concerned, i like my privacy. I think hackers could get into the system and mess it up."


the more technology the more security issues
ok

ecurity



My concern is always what if something happens what if the computer doesn't work then way sometimes it's always a good to have a manual backup
"It will distract drivers, but I do not think all people will want such high tech cars"

Too much going on to concentrate on driving

Good




"any hacker can get into anything, there is no reason to believe a cars system is any different. They can get into airplanes then they surely can get into cars"

Reason being because for each tier of technology thats released theres also a comparable security initive tied to its release.

Because I feel driver needs to be in control. Don't trust these systems and would allow drivers to rely on cars too much. Increase driving under influence because car can drive itself.
I know its for saftey but people going to start doing emails and facebook. I feel that younger drivers would be more destracted.

I think it will make it easier for criminals to get my personal information.





"I believe that a person who is behind the wheel should operate the auto, computers sometimes misfunction so theynsjould not be ultimately responsible for driving an auto"




I just feel I don't need it
hackers can break into lots of things now and doing it with autos is scary.



it is mainly about how susistible the car would be to hacking and losing control to hackers.

"Well, being completely run on computer technology, people could hack into your vehicle and either control it themselves, or use it to get information about you."

effective usage
good

It's about time companies improved safety among drivers with technology.
the ability to track our movements would be there
because you dont know if its fully trustworthy


Always being followed

Because sometimes t can cause a distraction for the driver


Because that way nothing bad happens to people.

They are making driving easy

because when i buy somthing i want to make sure i am sercus on everything in my car

computers aren't perfect and they are hackable.

Cool
"It's basically a computer and computers have glitches, viruses, etc. On other hand it maybe safer for someone who is drunk, I'd choose computer driver over him/her."
i believe the makers will have security measures in place before releasing such a product
The problem with integrating technology is that everything is connected. Our phones are connected to our computers which are connected to our cars now. It just makes you wonder if it's just too much exposure.

GREAT
Already the seatbelt detection is annoying enough imagine when you have all throes alarms going off driving will be torturous

Increased security measures
it makes commuting easier




I don't know

worry
Don't trust technology more than myself.
Only concern is of drivers no longer n paying attention to driving
to trust a computer to all things a human does is not a sure thing in my opinion.
getting additional techonolgies could make the car more hackable and the lack of human intervention could cause some troubles.
I am concerned about security breaches and hackers.

i dont yhink the technology is up to the job yet




uykguyk

nice

to much technology can mess up





i am always concerned about security




because it may not work

My identity has been hacked about 12 times in the last year or so.  I know that cars can be hacked.

Seems dangerous something could go wrong
I think people would rely too much on these technologies and not pay attention to what they are doing. They would not try to improve their driving skills.

yes to protect my vehicle during driving and also from obstacle or vandalisation
good

There is no real proof of the safty in these cars.
hacking

the new features do not adequately accommodate individual situations that arise daily requiring informed decision making between two bad choices
hackers are everywhere and can seem to get into anything at anytime it is very scary no one is secured now that technology has shifted to this direction the more they know about you the easier it is for them


possibaly open to hacks
more technology that could be hacked
"I do not consider it necessary, that would make us more useless with technology and replace a function that can be done by a sensor or a machine"
"I am concerned with my safety with additional technology integration because technology often malfunctions, which could then result in fatal accidents."
would love
Always concerned about someone hacking systems
"People love to hack things for their own enjoyment and I would hate to have some of those technologies hacked into, that could be very dangerous"

same as on my phone i think






because someone could hack it
its cool and new
It can and does distract the driver and leads to potential of the driver becoming too dependent on vehicle technology.

It leads to distracted driving. Components breakdown in my experience. They obscolesce quickly. They cost a lost to repair if they break. They don't add as much value as quality workmanship and reliability or purpose for vehicles. It is glitz and glam without real substance.

explain

"computers are hacked now, what if terrorists hack car computers and just crash them"


good


drive locally
if someone can stop my car during driving.
good
it sounds like a good idea but will it really work

Worry the car could be hacked and someone takes control.
"The more technology gets out there the less secure we are. It's the nature of technology. Identify theft increases every single day and cyber terrorism is the wave of the future, so it somewhat concerns me. But I choose not to live in fear, so it doesn't concern me more than somewhat."




I wouldn't want a target on getting my car jacked from me. Adding expensive technology makes me a good target for that.

It's a very nice feature
Securtiy not an issue.
I want full control of the car





dewq
People can try to steal the equipments from or out of the cars.




"Anything that assist in the safety, drivimg of a car should be one of the first thing that a vehicle owner should be concerned about"


"fc,khc"


they can make errors too!

i believe that there are plenty of things out there that protect me

can be hacked

Electronic failure is greater than human failure.

keep the car safe
cool
trust
all


"as I said earlier life is priceless so no matter how much is spent on security, that will always be there to protect us, no matter how magnificent driving cars Let no one is exempt from a car accident so if there are technological ways to protect because they do not use"


In think AI increases security by taking out the human error/human stupidity potential.
The great ethic question of automation is whether the vehicle will save the people in the car vs. saving the people outside of the car in an accident.
"This is such new technology, I would not try it until it has been in use for many years without any problems."


lkjklj
Too much big brother
yeah


Ive watched too many syfy movies
safety
"if a person wants to steal a car, they will steal the car at any cost.  as long as you keep it locked, and have insurance, there is nothing to worry about.  most of these features won't be able to be seen from the outside of the car anyway, and you would only know they were there if you were driving the car.  in that case, it is already stolen, and security of the car has been breached."

should help and not hurt
Safety nowadays is at the all time high to amny vraxy oeopleo out there
companies should try to protect the client rather than getting money
explain
need more assurance that it is foolproof







Justdoit-lyfehax



I wonder if it is possible to implement this technology. I can trust the self driving technology only to some extent. Although it reduces so much stress in driving. I think it would be better to have an option to activate/deactivate
I don't trust it


Just not concerned.
"I don't trust that the technology would function correctly/properly at all times. Too many cars have had recalls for simple things.  At such a high cost for these additional technology integration devices, it's not worth the risks.  People may also become complacent drivers.  Driving is a big responsibility that people need to take seriously."

too much information to be hacked

i dont know if it would be better or worse


Do not like these technologies
Possible issues with abuse or exploitation

The ability for hackers to access







Because I don't trust technology would be scared that someone could hack technology
system failure             tampering


No

worried about it being hacked and not working properly in general



Just doesn't seem safe
I just do not like that my car can connect to all of these things.

"just don,t think it would be safe"
i am always concerned about the security and the new additional features
I normally don't plan on breaking any traffic laws or hitting anyone with my vehicle. Technology can be a great benefit.

Concerned with hackers taking control of a car


I could say a lot in this section but I sum it up: do not change what works.
Privacy in all aspects.


i dont want it
"need to see it in action. i trust the self driving car, just not the humans driving around them"
none
invasion of privacy mostly.
goofd
Technology can be hacked and someone else can take control of the car and/or settings.  You lose the ability to control the car.
it is good

Hackers - software security is a big issue in my mind


too distracting



I would find it difficult to give control to something that's not human that would be operating in such varied situations where other's lives are at stake.



too much technology to worry about


drivers are distracted now - they don't need any more distractions to take their attention off driving

Technology is the way things get better

big brother has his hands on enough stuff now and I just don't trust computers all that much they still make way to many mistakes



i trust that the companies would make it safe and secure outta fear of lawsuits
"As long as there is always the human component to be used as backup, I may be ok with self-driving cars, but I don't fully trust the machines, or the people behind the machines that create and control the functionality."
Bcnzk
cool

scares me

This technology seems intrusive and easily tampered with or hacked into. I would not be comfortable relying solely on technology to safely get me from place to place.
its scary to think about that


Because I would probably not upgrade to a vehicle with additional technology as I don't need that.  Software nowadays appears to be easier to hack by hackers so I would not tempt fate by purchasing a vehicle with that technology.


"hackers are everywhere these days and if they can hack a computer, there is no question that they can hack into a cars tech settings"
theft of vehicle and owners details. traceability
great ideas
I am not comfortable with self driving technology

"You never really know when a technology could fail, or make a mistake so while im driving, my life would be in a technologies hand."

There are way too many distractions while driving
"If the system were hacked, it could become dangerous"

lack of trust in other operators.

how easy would it be to tinker iwth it and then it would not work when i want it
too many hackers


There are too many technology hacks these days so is always a concern
Concerned it may not work when needed
Identity theft happens every day - why add another opportunity
"cause i would not get any of it, so it does not matter to me"
Not sufficiently advanced AI to be an issue yet


Um well the car hackers could very easly highjack someone if they have computers available
Securith is an unkmnown


"People are losing focus as is, the addition of more technology adds more confusion and causes more people to lose focus."


As technology improves so does the ability of those who are out to steal whatever they can from someone else it becomes harder and harder for us to protect our own belongings from those who want to steal from us.

fgjjf
"I don't believe any system is completely secure and in addition, I would be worried about the vehicle being able to operate if one of the technology systems fail."


"How much do we entrust to another entity such as an unknown security force behind technology. What is done with that information? While it is designed for ease and comfort of the vehicle's driver and passengers, it also entreats on the user's privacy."
it will help me and my family when we drive
Additional technology creates lots of driver distraction. That is one of the reasons why self-driving technology is so important. I am concerned about reliability of very complex systems.


too distracting for drivers

"dfghjk fghjm hjui yuiop nm,  ghjkl ghjkl bnm,"
WOULD NOT TRUST IN ALL DRIVING OR WEATHER CONDITIONS AS BEING SAFE
I believe that everyone should drive responsibly and not rely on the vehicle too much.



Room for error and unknown

The way car's are built today they work from one brain and I that stops working so does everything else in the car

People who are technologically savvy have more of an opportunity to figure out how to do something negative or harmful with these systems
I think the security might become like a stalker and track your movements.
I do not think it is advanced enough yet to transmit any important information to anyone.








It's a new technology and could have many bugs etc

"It's very easy for professional hackers to access supposedly-secure information, and the information that's needed for some of these features is too personal to risk sharing."

Until it is proven for an extended period I would be concerned.
good

Very little confidence in reliability of something that may affect my personal safety


Technology breaks or malfunctions and is expensive to dix or replace.  People can't work on their cars anymore as the can't figure out what it wrong without the correct and expensive tech equipment



people taking joy rides and stealing things

"Multiple stories in the news about hacking, even at big corporation or government levels. Kids are getting smarter; I'm getting older and not as up-to-date on technology. If more devices are being controlled remotely, just how many frequencies are there before they start to overlap>?"

would be safe


"The Google car has already been hijacked. Anything can be hacked, and who would be at fault in an accident?"

Seat belts more tighter.
So much of our information and data is susceptible to breach makes this appear that this would be another way for information to be taken.

"If a self driving car hits someone, is the person in the vehicle going to claim they aren't at fault? If someone drives drunk and hits someone, but then tells the police they weren't really driving because the car drove itself, will they get away with murder?"
trustworthy



I would need to touch and try...there are lots of idiots on the road...can the computer anticipate what I am seeing from an erratic driver?

"Eventually, I'll likely trust it. I don't think it's quite there yet."
"I just don't trust all of this technology.  We are already being spied on without asking - why would I pay for loss of privacy.  And all these new technologies are not safe from people gaining access to them, which puts you and your property at risk."
"Ability to steal would be higher, anyone could do it."





would not be totally comfortable with automatic driving technology
Hackers
good
potential for hacking into the system





no reason





just more things to allow hacking
Doesn't seem very safe because computers aren't always 100% accurate. I like to be in complete control of my vehicle.

i'm not concerned because i'm too stupid to even know how i'm being compromised so.  what ya don't know won't worry ya.

"With all technology there is an inevitability for catastrophic failure, add in speeds in excess of fifty miles an hour and the likelihood of survival is null. Concerning the gps issue it wouldn't be a far fetched ideas that the car could be controlled and or monitored by an outside party resulting in death or great bodily harm."


It could be hackable
"If it can be programmed, it can be un-programmed"
At present because these things are very new to me and I don't know for sure how I could get used to some of it.
All i care about is how much easier it makes driving for me.








if they want my car they can have it. don't need all the new crap





Nothing to hide
It creates distruction

the information could be hacked

good

There's been a lot of stories about car software being hacked and people's lives be put in danger
Not everything is needed
improved
Technology and its progression with how we use it to function in life is ever progressing and we cannot escape the fact that our future will be geared towards technological implementations in every facet of it. So it goes without saying that new technological advancements will continue to grow within the automotive industry.




"the more technology we have in our lives the most suspectible to put ourselves to hacking, stealing, theft, etc"
With new technology comes new ways to hack and steal personal information.



the more technology the higher the risks of problems

"They already have people taken control over other people car's  so technology is not always a good thing people can hack your computer's smartphones bank accounts and so forth so I'm assuming it want be long before they start to control your car and have you and your family in  danger, they should think before technology starts to ruin people lives everything don't need to be changed  With new technology some things are better left alone family members will start to die when bad people get some"

I just don't see it as being an issue


privacy issues

Computer viruses and hacking have become an ubiquitous problem.
Too much technology would make a driver more dependent on it and more unaware of /uninterested in traffic conditions- potential for more accidents not less


donnt knw

Safety

computers are not reliable
I just don't really care about the government knowing where my car is
na
I'm not crazy.

saftey



"hacking, lost of communication."

it would make me nervous that it would mailfunction
The more complicated a vehicle is the more failures that occur.


I fear gps hacking and some of these seem to pose a threat of domestic terror.
"I think the increase of technology can lead to distraction, also more things can possiblity go wrong with the car or it could be cyber attacked"

I would be worried that the car would malfunction and not be able to perform on its own. Computer chip could go down or stop working. Safety worries


not sure how it will work


hacking

don't trust


"A car is a powerful machine. Adding too many extras and add ons makes it more susceptible to issues and problems. My car is a 2013 and because of the Eco mode available on it,I have constant issues with it. I don't think technology needs to be integrated THAT much."
"Knows a lot of personal information, could be major consequences for security breaches"
"Provide more distraction to the driver, taking the skill out of being able to control a vehicle"
Where I live there are not a lot of car break ins.










would not want to be distracted.

"There are Always glitches, freezes, and/or lost connectivity"


"I think that technology today has helped make vehicle security measures better. It's harder to break into a vehicle now than it was 20 years ago, and that can be attributed to technology."
theft is the biggest concern with some of these technologies theifs  will  not even have to be visible near the vehicle to start and have the vehicle drive it self away
tracking
i don't know
"As long as its not selfdriving, I love as much tech advancement on cars as possible"
Just gives theives one more reason to want to steal and dismantle your car.


worried about hacking of car to break into it or to take control of it while driving

safety




no
Its kind of hard to tryst in what you dont know.
I just don't see where there's a need for concern
"CAn be hacked, like any other technology"


Even computers make mistakes so I don't think it is 100% effective.



So many things about driving depends on others on the road not just the driver.
I am concerned about a vehicle being hacked into as I have heard of this happening.

"If something can connect to the Internet, it can be hacked"
Hackers are able to break into anything so the increase of security technology worries me that eventually they will be able to break in to my car or use my car against me while driving.
Tech. is everywhere.  I just want my car to be my car.  I want to get from A to B without it being a big production

with new tecnoligy I believe it should be safegarded


electronics have a tendency to crash and shut down

Too much potential for glitch

Technology fails sometimes



i am like its great stuff i just dont feel like its all that necesary
I wouldn't want someone to hack into my save information and place my family in danger.



no

"Yes. I am very concerned about the security of additional technology integration in vehicles as it is an important part of lifestyle that can be made convenient, safe and admirable."

seems like another way to track people and charge them for crap they dont need
too much can go wrong
Because people can hack  into technology
everything malfunctions at some point



More advance

i trust modern technology and feel it is safe

nto sure
"again, removing control from the individual"
because I feel better when I am in control
im sorry im not really sure.
I'd be concerned about hackers





Not that important for me at the present

technology failure


All of these systems can be hacked into and take control away from driver.


hacking

It would be concerning if there was potential for someone to hack into the system and steal the car.


I'm a responsible driver who thinks its not needed.
none
Sometime in the near future some people will be too busy using entertainment in their car that they would cause a crash.

Everything is getting hacked and electronics are unreliable
to much current ability to hack control of current vehicles


Hacking can be an issue what of the technology goes out and causes an accident
human and computer error i could see lots of wrecks



some one can hack into it
its new

I think it's more dangerous



Its safe nowadays
Mechanical issues occur all of the time. I do not trust technology to drive my vehicle. It is a scary thought especially when we would be relying on it to do something with our lives at risk.

"People can hack computers, get people's credit card info amongst other things. If you crest a car that doesn't need a real key, or can drive on its own then what if people can hack into a car and make it so harmful things. I have heard of vehicles being hack to take off the brakes and be put into neutral. It just doesn't seem safe."



Will the technology work properly.
to many break ins



"I am very concerned because of how easily experienced and determined hackers can gain access into the vehicles. I certainly would enjoy the integrated technology, but am very concerned at how much we can do to make sure that nobody could hack into the vehicle's system and take control of it."

Smartphones aren't as secure as people think.  the vulnerability of data communicated via a smartphone would be increased with additional technology in cars with access to the cell phone data.


I really like it
















The best of all of them and then it will be a good time waster and I love
north korea might hack us
I would need more information on anti-hacking safeguards.




Hackers



With technology there is always a concern for security since hacking is a thing of the present. I wouldn't want some random person to access my biometrics.

Hacking possibility
This technology is new and may be compromised
I think some change is good. Hopefully additional technology will decrease road fatalities.

I'm an older generation and I feel like my car now had many of these features included.  Could not afford to add any of them at this time. Been driving  45 years and have done fine. Worry that technology is watching your every move with some of these features.
Na
Possibility of glitches or malfunction.
All features added increase the cost of the vehicle and increase the susceptibility to theft

"there are so many concerns but for starters i am very concerned about being hacked and having no control of my vehicle. other issues could be viruses, wifi connection?, bugs, glitches...any one of these could have life altering consequences."

I think I need a human at the wheel.
It takes some getting used to
It is necessary for us

cost
Human is smarter than car

not sure
can it be hacked

What if sensors fail to protect
Hackers



Idk
I don't like extras

It would be dangerous if it malfunctioned.  I am not ready to trust a machine with that

There are intelligent criminals




yes

"If the security of additional technology integration were to be ""compromised"" in any fashion, for instance, ""hacking"" by an outside source,, it will never be the consumer's fault should that occur.  Vehicle manufacturers bear the responsibility to ensure that all technology integrated into vehicle systems are safe to use and well-guarded from cyber attack."


Just great



It is a new technology that has not been tested enough in order to garner publics trust
How big of a computer they have to install in the vehicle how much bigger would you need for a battery. If power goes out everything goes out.


I just would not trust the cars system to make all the driving decisions
just not
If you're not doing anything wrong you usually don't have much to fear. This is a naive thought on my part. But I try not to make mountains out of molehills. And probably won't have too much technology on my vehicle anyway. I'm not a fan of too much extra unnecessary stuff on a car or motorcycle.
It's new and I'm not yet comfortable with it.




I worry about hackers controlling cars
Hackers are very good
Unproven and does not practically account for unforeseen variables.





Because I have not seen them in action.  Once they are out in the marketplace I would be willing to consider using the new technologies.  I am concerned about someone else using the new systems and running into me!
"technology has taken over our world, however more often than not there are glitches and updates continuously needed"


security issues.
I've heard cars can get hacked into. If I'm in a self driving vehicle and something goes wrong it's life threatening.
I don't think you can worry about everything.  If you have auto insurance I would hope to be covered for any breach of security

not safe
Too many gadgets means too much confusion about their operation.





Because when u have more technology more things are likely to go wrong or break.

Takes driver control awzy


Because if it goes wrong there is still human control
Doesn't seem like it will increase security risk



technology is dangerous at times n can be miseading



most of them will just increase distractions and make drivers more lazy
I just don't know enough to make an informed decision.
I think that technology will/has progressed far enough where we can trust these things.




cause I can
"I'm not an early adapter of technology, so it's hard for me to say ""in 36 months, my next care will be technology integtrated."""


The driver my be distracted or lose control of the car

Don't really trust the reliability

Don't like robots

just seems too weird

"It's a danger with all technology, but I an auto, my life could be at risk."
It's new--I think it will take some time to work out any bugs.
I FEEL THAT THERE CAN BE ENOUGH SECURITY TO PROTECT US
i'm very concerned of the cost of these things
Well there is allways that percentage where you feel a little uneasy about it

bad people worker are everywhere
Hacking and cars having fulltime internet access it would have to be properly firewalled or discreet as not to have net access
I feel that the more info I give out about myself thru technology the more likely I am to be a victim of identity theft

its good
Because there could be a lot of serious repercussions if the systems are hacked in to.
worry that my vehicle might get hacked
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT SWERVES TO MISS SOMETHING
not sure about technology
i have heard they have been having accidents in california
"Not sure if some are needed, and about how often I would use them."



tr rtrt rtrt rtrt




there are hackers out there trying to break into different systems every day. this would be another opportunity for them to try to steal peoples information.


its such a new techology i would have to see it proven before i would try it

I do not put personal information in the technology I own plus who cares about me and what I do I don't honk most ppl are out to get me or want to know my stiff
I have heard on the news where someone has hacked into a vehicle and controlled it


nice nice

"I don't fully trust the current technology's ability to react properly to every situation. There are so many variables in driving that I don't quite trust an algorithm or set of pre-programmed responses to problem-solve and well and as quickly as a human (or as well as I would personally at least). I also hold the attitude that the more moving parts there are, the more likely something is to go wrong when it comes to adding bells and whistles."

i trust the system


its a hackable world

Because technology has been being added for awhile
i don't know what it can do


Not concerned
distractions.
do not want any more of my information floating around to be hacked

There is still a certain amount of risk.
who can gain access?





"Everything breaks or misperforms. A car or truck is too dangerous to trust to an electronic, non-human, driver."










I don't know what kind of safety/security can be ensured. I know that nothing is 100% secure.

difficult to learn


not safe

dont trust it

accessing the phones of strangers on the curb seems a little creepy to me

Cause it doesn't make the car any more cost effective or cost efficient.
Privacy is at risk with the intrusive tech being promoted.  It's no ones business but mine in regards to how I drive and where.

I am concerned because of privacy

technology can fail and should not be solely relied upon

I WORK FOR A DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT I SEE HOW PEOPLE RELY ON THESE SYSTEMS AND WHEN THEY FAIL THEY CRASH THEY SOLEY RELY ON THIS AND YOU CANT

I don't need the racking and big brother looking over my shoulders. The cost of these items is way to high for the normal consumer and they do not lessen the cost of insurance.
too much information floating out there
"Because I have been hearing about so many security breaches in so many different situations, I think that anytime of technology can be hacked."



"Well, if you're talking about computer hacking I don't see any real threat to the owner. If you're talking about auto theft, I believe the tech. described would deter criminals."

human control of a vehicle is safer than electronics
I think that additional technology integration into vehicles is a great idea and I know that they would test the automobiles before they were allowed to drive  people around so why should I  worry
"Technology is fabulous, but human life is precious.  Trusting technology to assume much of what a human has traditionally done is dangerous. It takes out much of the element of human options."

"If something should malfunction you have no control.  Also, it is very important that the driver of the vehicle be in control at all times.  I feel that people, especially new drivers would get lazy and depend on technology to operate the vehicle instead of the driver always being in control of their car"




"Sometimes the more features that are in a car, the more potential for problems."

I trust the manufactures


More tech means more possible hack targets/weaknesses
safety
"Wheeze, you never know who's watching your driving. Potential hackers could take your car, or at the vey least know where you drive and sent you stupid email adverts for products and service you do not need."
They cause additional distractions and prevent drivers focus on driving safely.

You don't want the car smarter than you

very low chance of anything happening


Too many things are being hacked already.  It could really be dangerous.





safety and liability

not safe for private info

"I think that cars come with so much technology that driving skills are decreasing and people aren't paying attention to the road or the surroundings, because the cars are doing too much for them. You still need to be alert when driving and the new technologies make us lazy."
room for improvement

"In most cases, I don't worry about big brother."

don't know how secure anything is these days.
"After watching things like this happening in tv dramas, it is a pretty scary scenario. Not that I perceive myself as any sort of target but what if a hacker over-rides the system for the fun of witnessing a crash. Also, where there is new technology, there is room for error and malfunction so I wouldn't be on board early. Also, what if someone else's car goes biserk and crashes into me? I realize the google car drives automatically but that is just one vehicle."
"Takes a lot of control out of the driver.  However, that may not be a bad thing for a lot of people."
"driver will not have full control anymore, what about if technology fails,"
More things to go wrong

"concern about hacking , glitches"

not sure






"once you're used to it, no distraction"
too many endpoints create entry points
technology ok

Hackers have been able to get into too many devices.  I would not want my life tracked without my consent.








wouldn't want someone to tap into it


"The more stuff in the vehicle, the more tempting to break in to steal something......unless stuff becomes standard in the majority of vehicles."
Others could hack into your car and could essentially take over either while you are driving or steal your car easier.


something conscious about it


I've been driving a long time and doing it on my own. I don't feel comfortable trusting that certain new technologies would work at %100. The thought of it makes me feel very anxious
it is very distracting to drivers
Someone will always be interested in hacking the technology
Its my right and I'll use it.


Identity theft.
"My concern centers around the unknown possible use of information collected by technology in vehicles.  I do not trust the ""people in charge"" to only use technology for its original intended purpose.  No one needs to know where my vehicle is or what my driving tendencies are.  I don't even like the  existing technology in my GMC which tells my dealer when my car needs an oil change.  It's an invasion of privacy."


I am concerned that with the increased technology will come an increased risk of my vehicle being able to be hacked by outside individuals. With the self driving technology I specifically worry that someone could gain control over my vehicle and possibly cause a crash.





"I am not sure how safe it is going to be with a self driving car.  with all the integrated technologies, people intervention/control is less - what happens if there is a problem, would the car still function?  We had problems one time with power window - it would not open or close.  What happens if something more serious goes wrong?"
Hackers
Hacking issues.
"I think people are already bad drivers with the current technologies available, they will get worse as we start to integrate more technology into our cars that's ""supposed"" to be helpful and less distracting"




I have no indication that this technology has been proven totally secure at this time.
Systems could possibly be 'hacked' and security violated
dont know if it would work




i don't trust it. i only trust my self to drive the car.
More potential for failing technology that people become reliant on.

Because with all the sensors on the self driving vehicle is safer then a human driver
can be hacked
"More distractions, too much to learn"



too many ways for people to bypass the technology




Technology will malfunction
Already they have problems with a devise that can extend the electronic key range I have to keep my keys in special bag when I will be close to my parked car


I wonder how much responsibility might be removed from the driver.  Who pays in the event of an accident?


Its a computer and could have a glitch
too much technologt


always issues with technology lock ups or other glitches


"Taking control of a vechicle has already been done, and don't forget the ""Stuck Gas Pedals"" on Toyotas."





afraid other people can use/review if close enough or in my car
hacking incidents recently
Technology can mess up.

I feel like there are so many options to improve safety. I am not concerned
Hackers

no it's an issue but not losing any sleep
there are too many ways a computer could fail. I simply cannot release control of a heavy object traveling at 60 mph (more or less)when other vehicles are present. Too many ways things could lead to disaster.





I use the internet all the time and the security just doesn't concern me.



Control is now beyond the driver of the vehicle and could be interrupted by outside hackers
The more programs that are added to vehicles the more chances are that someone can hack into your system


Highu

Technology can go wrong and cause a fire


none
It is very easy to steal identities and I would be concerned about this happening to me


not sure


Too much!
always leave a chance for theft of car and info
none
Technology still have to be proven safe and effective.



Too costly

Some person could take over the auto be remote control and make it do what they want it to do

Someone could breach the security and cause accidents or theft.
I trust it

"Technology can't always anticipate the current driving conditions.  Until you can prove to me that there are not unintended consequences in utilizing this type of technology, I'm going to refuse it."
Concerned with increased crime thru technology
hackers
Hacking is possible.


Nope
It gives another entry point for hackers to get your personal info & also provides another distraction for drivers
have not seen fool proof tech yet
"So much is dependent upon computers.  Would the car still run and would I have any control if someone ""broke into"" the security of my car?"

Technology can fail.


I'm not concerned about my phone giving me directions and adding things to my calendar or telling me when my next meeting is. Why should I worry about a car that can do that?



gooooooood




stupid tech not needed
would not trust it

security is important
not a concern to me
Simple is better  Making life better  Security is not an issue
I've had emails hacked and that's not even in a car. So I imagine thieves will figure out that they can access all sorts of info through the car technology.

Basically having a man made machine controlling another machine that moves humans around? Sounds like a recipe for disaster at one point or another.
There is always room for error or a computer mishap.
anything can be hacked
Technology is too new at this point.


Don't want people to break into my car werevi have all my expensive item and gadget



have heard about people being able to hack into the system

i don't use much technology so am unlikely to be impacted by the security or lack of with integrated systems
I believe the increased use of technology to control our lives poses serious risk from dishonest individuals.
"the more features you add, the greater the chance that something will go wrong."

"Until we try, we wont know all the problems that can arise"
no reason
"If these innovative robots, i mean vehicles have a mind of their own they could decide to rebel and make their own choices and follow their own laws and rules and reroute their path."

not enough is known and there seems to be a great deal of hackers

The last of the mohicans promentory

already too comples


"Anything and everything can be hacked. Besides, if your car automatically stops if you are about to hit a person, that sounds great at first. What if that person is trying to attack or shoot you? Wouldn't it be a good idea NOT to have your car stop?"

Hacking
hacking and data breaches are becoming an everyday occurance
not confident with the technology at this time
Feel like to many things could go wrong.


"Am proficient in motor vehicle repairs, electronics, computers. It is so easy to hack into all your electronics, none of it is secure. Know ing what I know about vehicle maintenance & repair and experience with my own vehicles, it all fails and is getting extremely expensive to repair. It's all tied intogether and when one sytem fails it affectsthe other systems. People spend too much time operating all the touch screens foe all the contolling of heating, ventilation, radio, CD, Cell phones, etc"
More technology means more ways for people to hack in and get your personal information.

Can be hacked
I worry about the keyless entry and ignition because it just seems too easy to get access once a driver has approached their vehicle. And how secure is the information on mobile phones connected to vehicles?
"maybe it's because I am nave; but, I think additional technology isn't any more at risk of security issues than a laptop or smartphone."

seems like the government would have more access to what you ARE DOING AND WHERE YOU ARE GOING


I dont trust those things

Digital for lock are good enough
"I don't think the information is so important that it needs to be totally secure, unless it involves financial transactions."


"Concerned about malfunctions, hacking, and just simply prefer to do things myself with minimal automated features"
thats just the way things are today
safety
yo what if it aint work im fuked


sdth fgfgh f sfhfh






"With so much integration, I worry important information could be susceptible to hacking."
too much technology has the potential for too many malfunctions or even viruses
Coos could shut down the car

A computer can't predict what a human driver may do.

"We really do need to have some type of brain power going while driving. These options sound great for those who may be physically impaired, however, for me, I do not think it is something I desire at this time."
Unless all vehicles equipped how can a vessel interprete a strangers way of thinking
n/a
I am concern because it is for my safety
making sure everything is right

Only trust myself
Don't buy right away wait and see
it seems to be key factor in the way the car works





I am anxious if I don't have control. Machines do not operate 100 percent all the time
It can sometimes cause a accident if the car has a malfunction.


too much can go wrong


i would hope that the makers have fixed it
I've seen several TV news reports on this type of technology being over taken by some other person which could be troubling.

"To have scar completely made up of cellphones, cameras, recorders, laptops, tvs, gps units, routers, pagers, and fax machines; doesn't exactly sound appealing in the least It's scary! And doesn't really sound that safe.. We can't put all of our faith, time, and money into remote control car! It's ridiculous, to say so in the least! But this is the retarded generation we engulfed ourselves in. Why not cure and aid the sick and leave a car a car, stop trying to turn into a rocket/UFO learn 2 drive"


great

First it is fairly new in the market andcnot enough data to thoroughly access and second i aget concerned that drivers may become reliant on this technology and not make wise decisions



the more tech the better for everyone


It just doesnt

Recently I have read about hackers with the capability of getting into the cars tech system and taking over or accessing private info
to much info to be hacked or use by another party
I am leery of taking the human out of parts of driving and the possibility of electro/mechanical failure.

Im just not i don't need to explain
More hackers can hack into your information and steal it.




dfrtgyrhyhr
Hackers
everything seems vulnerable with more technology

Afraid they could fail at any moment which creates risk for the driver

Too many things could go wrong


its concrning

Technology (especially car tech) isn't entirely reliable. And high-tech security is always sharing our personal information with those we wish not to have it.

Because everything can malfunction based on care of product.


i know how to drive it is others that dont and would need these things



times
I feel I can control it better than letting it drive itself


Hacking seems to be on the rise and an not sure security has kept up
it takes away free will

it would seem errors are possible in the future

"Have you ever had a computer crash (blue screen) or Iphone run out of power and die ? What happens when the computer driving your car has this happens ? People need to pay More attention to driving not less. I think there is some good tech that can be incorporated in driving like the emergency stop, pedestrian watcher etc. but the driver should be paying attention and driving."
"You hear so many stories now of people hacking into different systems, even government, so I'm sure they would find a way to do the same with your car and possibly steal it. Get into your personal info also."

I'm just Leary or worried it might do something it's not suppose to do


"They are distracting; people text, talk, and forget that their main priority is to look, listen, and drive with both hands on the wheel!"
The ability for it to continue operating correctly
great brand


I'd be afraid of getting hacked or a glitch or malfunction
"people would forget about driving, and just play with the additional technology."

"The more we depend on additional technology in vehicles, the number of accidents will increase. Most accidents are caused by humans not paying attention while driving."
Just seems like it could be scary to rely upon technology to drive cars without human input...but so msny terrible and distracted drivers msybe it would be safer

"hackers could get your personal information, possibly steal your car, and/or mess up technology driven functions like driving without human input"



"Because every single app needs to know information that has nothing to do with what the app is proposing to do.  For instance, there is no reason for any app to have access to your friends."

i think you should be able to drive the cars your self if you can`t then don`t drive


it could be a dangerous factor
Auto companies would be extremely shortsighted to sell integration technology without protecting their customers security and privacy.
the technology hasn't been perfected
I lease

dello dello
A lot of the technology is connected to a smartphone. What if I lose my phone? What if someone else steals my phone and subsequently uses that to steal my car?

I have nothing that can be taken from me via technology in a vehicle

Safety performance improvements will make all future my car is prepared for all kinds of problems or accidents by avoiding them

i don't know enough about it

"i worry that the technology would prevent me from having any control over the vehicle, and i might get into a situation that the technology cannot correct."
Hacking could prove disastrous.



"Nothing is perfect when it comes to technology, at first. It takes time to iron out ALL bugs"
Peopel breaking into the technology itll be easier










safety of everybody


too expert

not sure

Computers aren't perfect and can't take into account certain things so sometimes a human driver might be the best option
Could be hacked
"I do not believe that there will be many downsides to the increasing technology integration in vehicles. If anything, the improvement in the driving experience and safety outweighs any concerns."
Not sure  but I don't think there would be a big security issue.
"I think the more technology incorporated into vehicles, the greater risks of car accidents. Most of us have smartphones which we spend most of our time on as it is, incorporating that into a vehicle would reduce the safety of the vehicle"

security measures are built in everywhere

hackers
I'm not sure what they would steal.


i like to be safe

HACKING


Because there is always someone looking to do crime!!

it is high tech and hard to understand


The more technology built into the vehicles the more people would want to break in and steal the expensive technology.
"My current navigation system frequently malfunctions, I think every smart system would also suffer the same problems"
afraid of hackers taking control of my car
"They seems safe and advanced, but they are not able to predict other drivers behaviors"
na



could be hacked easily like so many others





Because so many things can be hacked into - cars would be the next obvious targets


I'm just not

"I don't see technology dominating my vehicle...computers don't wish to be transported.  People will break into cars whether or not they can hack a computer, so any threat resulting from integration is minimal."
I do not trust any of that stuff. i have an iphone and a bunch of tablets and stuff but anyone can get there way into there personal life
great technology feature for the handicaps
"security  is necessary in vehicles which is important. means camers, hidden handle etc."


It may distract from the driving itself


"Hackers can, will and already have hacked cars with technology integrated into them to do horrible things, this could be a way for a sociopath to kill people without ever know how or why. I am strongly against the integration of a technological based system with remote access."




no technological advances are 100% perfect. a glitch may cause the car to start/stop on its own

technology can be jammed or altered by outside influence.

I just don't know enough about it to make a real decision but I am interested.
Might not be accurate

It's is important to manage the technology very well.
"As the driver, I like to be in control.  It would be a little nerve racking if the car would be the one in control."
dsfk ksdjldj d

This will give us a secured feeling wherever we travel
security is must


Because I can?
I don't think I want the car doing the decision making for me while I'm in it.  I rather my own judgement be used






hacking

drivers need to keep their eyes on the road
need to work out details
not safe

who is to blame if there is an automatic error - I am responsible so give the responsibility
This would depend upon how much personal information the user is sharing.
unsafe
"They are un-tested.  Also, people will hack it or ignore good sense and others will be hurt or die as a result."
ayyyn gnfgbfg
"Because with every extra line of code, there's that much more potential for something to go wrong. If my computer at home crashes, I just reboot it. If the computer in the car crashes, the car crashes with it."





"hackers already break into computer systems, what's to stop them from hacking a car's computer system and using it as a weapon??"
It does seem possible to hack into the technology and have data stolen.



Privcy concerns

rtwertwrt


"technology dont always work precisely, when one part is broken the whole parts become malfunction, that could be dangerous when peoples rely on it when driving"
More problems are sure to arise and the cost to maintain or repair would negate the posiives.
hackers can control the cars






too much info out there



cars would be safer or government and automakers would not sell

There is too much hacking currently.
new technology is happening very quickly and you hear about hacking every day. i don't know if it's possible to be 100% safe

I want my phone and other files to remain private.


technologies are important  am sure would have security built in
With the modern security features present today there is no readon for me to be concerned
I would be ok with something like this for town driving after really doing a lot of research but I would like it to be that you can switch to manual operation in a nanosecond . I would need lots of data and info on the trials before entertaining this. I would not want to be responsible for harming or killing others or would I wish to be involved in an accident due to malfunctions


Because I don't use or connect to it
crazy people






Computer glitches
Don't want others to be able to hack into the system
I dont know

x
I have kid


Some one could hack into it....  not good
security is ongoing and the need for continuous updating is very important
Driverless vehicles concern me
Too many distractions


technology has done fine so far so why not try something new

this type of technology opens more doors for a breach of technology
Not so trusting....
you never can be too safe

Shouldn't be concerned if it makes it safer
"Because it does not affect me, we don't need all the technology in cars"
I would be too nervous of giving over the controls and allowing technology be in control




Concerned about the small percentage of people out there who use technology for nefarious purposes
The computer in a vehicle is not the same as a physical heart pumping human being.  We can't fully rely on a machine to do everything for us.

there are too many unkown problems that could occur having this type of technology on vehicles.
technology is currently a distraction to drivers
driver has the ability

I know how to protect my data.

anything can get hacked these days
no
There seems to be a desire of more and more people to hack.





Because I won't have them.

liability

Never thought about it
I would need proof that a machine could think as well as a good driver


It's all new and I would want it to be tested first
I don't understand it enough to really know and the answers you gave do not allow me to say so


Just don't feel like it is a risky technology
I think there are too many potential problems.

"I don't know enough about the technology, and if it's been tested enough."

to much to go wrong or break down
vehicle manufacturers would not knowingly install insecure systems.

I don't like the fact that areas of my life would be shared for public knowledge.
i just don't trust computers to do things a human does. humans are still necessary

They have to be tested and tried to verify their safety
privacy
I don't know enough about the technology to feel comfortable with it
Don't know who could access my data.
it could be hacked or malfunction at random times
"There are some ""hacking"" scenarios I've seen in the media that are concerning. For example, controlling a few vehicles to block a road would create a risky situation."

i trust these
You can hack anything now

too many things to go wrong

to save energy
"Hackers take advantage of the widespread popularity of technology and as we really more and more on that technology, there is a growing concern for our security."
We become too reliant on tech and don't use common sense.


There have been instances of hackers controlling vehicles through their on board computer systems. Keeping the systems to a minimum and making laws that charged people with attempted Murder needs to considered first.
People are hacking things from phones to cars even the government and that's very scary I would need some reassurance

It doesn't occur to me
others could gain control of car apps
"Software writing is not an exact science.  Small bugs can lead to fatal results.  Likewise the machines on which the software runs are subject to failure, both catastrophic or simply annoying.  Just like flying, I want a human available to take over if ""HAL"" does not want to cooperate.  Additionally, any system with a connection to the outside world is subject to being corrupted by outside forces who may not have my best interests at heart."

Because someone can access through my personal information

Because I would rather have control over my vehicle instead of driving for e. I would feel safer knowing I have control of what happens without any glitch that could malfunction.


Not crossed my mind much


security and crime

"It's not necessarily the tech, but the driver. Some people can't use something hands free even if their life depended on it. And some of the tech has become unnecessary in a vehicle."


"there will always be theives, but i would expect the developer to put safeguards in place"

The other drivers on the road
"Hackers are constantly figuring out ways to get into some of the most secure systems in the world. Even if the car electronics were secure upon purchase, in would only be a matter of months until some evil person figured out how to hack it. If it is self driving, the hackers could drive you right into a booby trap where you would be mugged, robbed, or killed. What's more, technology fails, computer's lock up or crash, and it would be even more susceptible to this in extremes of auto environment."

Very nice and very clean

Malfunctions.
With so much technology involved it is easy access for companies to find out alot about myself

they do not have instinct and are too basic

"If a live person is not navigating, my son amd I will NOT be in it. Too scared!"
"They are in a early state, in the future they will be better, Im pretty sure"


Seems like something with the potential of being hacked.

it's a machine..not a human


more ways people to hack and take over
Unreliable

HACKERS !
Hackers stealing private info
Hackers


Too much technology will create lazy and dumb drivers
not really


People already refuse to be reonsible for their actions in and out of vehicles. This takes the onus off ofnthem entirely


it just raises the price of cars. Can't afford it
need to learn more about the risk

It can be hacked

Identity theft




no comment
Security seems to be a big issue anywhere there are interconnected computers.

I am somewhat concerned because of tv shows and movies showing things with more and more technology can be hacked.

I don't think it is easy to hack the information
I do not see the problem.

Could let an outside entity take over the car
Technology can be wiped out with more technology theives will find a way to make it easy to steal thongs
You should jsut restart



What if the battery goes dead?



malfunction of devices

"I don't know, Im just not"
any one can hack into the system
I like control of what I am driving



More technology just seems like more of a way to be tracked or hacked
"things get hacked, people become less responsible and capable, there are always ""glitches"""



hacking


I just don't know that I could ever completely trust a computer to drive myself and my family without my input

i think it is another way big brother can get into our lives

hacking
Not enough information

"Technology such as displays and entertainment offer more distractions for the driver. In some environments such as remote locations or with experienced users, this will not be an additional risk, but with others such as congested unknown areas or new drivers, the risk of distraction will be high."

"Software needs to be thoroughly vetted before I would accept it. For instance Tesla Autopilot is pretty good, but I wouldn't yet trust it in unforeseen conditions."

Too many ways to hack into the system and too may smart hackers out there to do it!
"some of the features seem intrusive-  such as my vehicle having the ability to ""pick up"" the signal of pedestrian cell phones."

Concern is neither maximal nor minimal

"The weak link is usually the user - too many idiots out there. Also, in cases of system failure, people who are not prepared/able to manage situations"

"I think we can get too distracted thinking about an incoming text/email, etc, when we should pay better attention to the road and obstacles we face while driving."
hacking in general is a growing concern
"It gives hackers more of an opportunity and what if they can hack into it while I am in the car, or to steal my car."


driving such a long time on my own.  will have to get use to this technology

Allows for too much multitasking on driver's part

"if there's more high tech things to steal, people are more likely to do so"


What if the computer glitches
"DRIVERS NEED TO DEDICATE FULL ATTENTION TO DRIVING, WHILE MANY OF THE NEW TECH FEATURES SUPPORT LAX HABITS BEHIND THE WHEEL"

need to have reflex and smarts of a human

i think like it



Not sure

I think that as this technology develops and becomes more common that hacking will occur and none of these systems function correctly now.
"There are many ways people can steal information. This is just another way to make it available. Since it is a new technology, the security will be behind."
I would want some assurance from the manufacturer that safeguards were installed to prevent hacking and viruses from being loaded in the car from phones or phones being hacked through the vehicle

No concern


You never know what will happen.
If security was compromised it could make for an extremely dangerous situation


I am concerned a little bit about pretty much all kinds of technology.
Some of the technology is necessary some isn't

because so many things are hacked and I would not want my car to be



good
q

ghgh

none

Our privacy may not be as private as we think. How would I know it's not being used to spy.


On my smartphone everyone knows where i am even where I  have driven. There is no privacy anymore


love
I just don't see where this could be safe without an actual driver in the seat. if there is a malfunction in the computer than what? would we be blamed with the insurance?
Identity theft

Tech is still a bit to new.

Older drivers are not used ot having distractions in the vehicle. We must eliminate anything that requires that you take your eyes off or hands off. Most of the technology is too expensive and only the rich can afford it.

More valuable for thieves


Driver Distraction.


"If I don't like it, I won't buy it."
I trust it will be well designed
good











safety while driving - distractions



have never been hacked or had identity stolen
seems that no one obeys speed limits and stops a controlled car seems to slow things down
I Don't trust technology enough
Anything this connected is going to be hackable by people

Because of technology glitches and I prefer to be in control
The additional technolology on vehicles is important for the security in the people


I find many of the new technologies increase safety and security. In the 2013 Cadillac I recently turned in I had to glance down at the screen often to do routine tasks and I didn't like taking my eyes off the road even for a few seconds. My new Cadillac has solved much of that with heads up and expanded cameras and warning systems. I am comfortable with the level of safety and security protections in my Porsche.



I feel that i cant trust the tech yet. I have never experienced it personaly and i worry about people relying on it to a fault




"Even if you put in your destination, there are people and animals that some times make decisions that can cause an accident.  Or maybe you change your mind about where you are going..."





about technology.. very talk in the innovation
Provides more and more distractions; makes cars more attractive to thieves.



its just too good sometimes to believe will trust when im able to try it out
What if someone got your fingerprint or what ever is needed. Or someone hacks your on board computer






"They would not release them to the public if they were not safe, or at least very well tested"
"i think it's a neat feature, it might be scary"

"no no  , it is very safly"

"Still untested completely.  After a couple years of use, I will be more comfortable with this technology."
Technology can have interruptions in service
safety



Hackers




I must have misinformed. I am not concerned about the security of additional technology integration in vehicles
Technology is getting way too advanced. We really don't need all the new things that are becoming available to us. I think it makes us lazy as well as sets us up for disaster.
Gadgets fail - so I would only want ones that I can double check on and/or override.  Focus on alternate fuels not all this crap you just asked me about.
because computers are hacked everyday

Because people need to pay attention to driving not anything else that may be distracting.  Driving is a serious thing







Thieves
There is room for error on both a human and non human driver. both can fail and the driver would be charged and held for either mistake



I trust it to a minimum
Makes cars hackable
they could get a virus just as easily as a computer

Hackers are evreywhere.


"I worry about hackers being able to cause you to have an accident, or to be able to spy on you with the camera technology"


I think overall it will help with safety.



Seems cool
"Every day we hear of another place being hacked. The Irs even, why would I want to risk the ability of some crazy smart person hacking my car and driving me off a cliff?  Obviously that's extreme, but the more technology we have theess control the driver actually has."

The potential for the vehicle's software being hacked.


"too advanced, privacy concerns"

I like to be in control under my own steam.
there isn't secure information in them
just seems odd

Dont want someone hacking my car or recordongs things happening

gigog fdutr jyfo jyyfv
It opens the doors to cars being hacked. That can already happen with something as simple as onstar.
I have faith they will do a great job


It's a new technology and I don't know the nuts and bolts behind how it is being used and how my info is being shared and stored.

"with all the new technology today, everyones imformation is much easier for hackers to steal"
Seems full of security.

Dont care.
