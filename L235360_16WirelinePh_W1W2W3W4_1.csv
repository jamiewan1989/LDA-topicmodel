The service seems good since no trouble with connection but this could change as well. I have received many cranks calls and I feel it is from Comcast since I am not employed and stay at home all day and when the billing is due they want it that day; so the calls are worse as well as my emails.

The company's entire focus is on new customers and the long-term customers aren't valued.74663,74665,74668,The transition to Frontier has been terrible. It took weeks to transfer accounts.

I would absolutely recommend Verizon FIOS without question.  However, during the changeover from Verizon to Frontier many people in my area experienced outages with phone or Internet or TV service.  More than two weeks after the changeover some services are still not available.  If Frontier fixes these problems and gets their web interface and Apps to do all the things that we could do with our Verizon service, then I would also give them a higher rating, but for now the change to Frontier has resulted in having fewer features, worse service while paying the same prices.  Frontier needs to get better quickly or many in my area will move to Time Warner or Direct TV."74797,I hate calling them because nothing seems to get done quickly74799,outages are too frequent74809,Slow speeds....74810,74811,"service work ok, most of the time"74812,cannot recall a any issues in the past. service has been good74815,I think there are better plans out there.

I might even be using FIOS now if they didn't want to install a silly dish on the roof for TV.  Now that Charter has purchased Bright House, my rating may go up to a ""10"" if the service performs consistently and experiences the promised price drop Charter is discussing.

Past experience with Brighthouse has been mixed; with new wiring in a new house it performs well, but in older residences the technicians struggled to get it working properly in many cases. I have had BHN as my provider at over 7 residences, and FIOS at one.

FIOS, then, used the faster level one network. Now they are transitioning to a slower network of servers. Charter stands to gain the most from this foolish move on the part of Verizon, in my opinion.

Unfortunately, AT&T does not provide service where I live. We are currently looking into changing our provider. The internet connection is just way too slow for today. With so many devices constantly connected to Wi-Fi, it only makes sense to go wireless. Also, my dad doses not watch enough television to purchase a cable subscription, as they can get rather costly, so we are also looking into purchasing the Amazon Fire Stick - another device that will definitely need the connection speed of wireless to run smoothly."132939,Usually good service132960,why not132983,great products133025,It's the only company in rural town I live in133107,133136,133197,only one we can get133263,133295,SERVICE IS VERY GOOD133341,Service133410,133419,Pretty good company but still working out the kinks133420,overpriced monopoly133422,they are easy and no problems133440,"It's fine.

It took SEVERAL hours of us contacting them through phone calls, email etc and no one seemed to know what anyone else at the company was doing.  Then our first two bills we were grossly overcharged but once we filed a complaint about being overcharged they did remove the bogus charges from our bill.
