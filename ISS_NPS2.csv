221299,I am a bit disappointed that my rate was raised upon renewal without a given reason. I had to phone them myself and ask why. I feel the reason for raising a rate on your client should be detailed in the renewal notice.

205098,I am an AARP member and I called them when I bought a new car.  Their quote was excellent to the company I had been with for over 47 years.

295250,I believe we are paying too much for what we are getting.
254441,"I cannot give full points because we have only just signed up with this insurer, but their coverage seems broad, fair, and the rates reasonable."
295874,"I can't give a 10 because I have not had insurance w/Amica long enough to have tested its claims and service.  The premiums are higher than Auto Owners but I have heard that customers have been very pleased and stay with Amica, so I am hopeful that paying more give better service and more concern about the policy holder's possessions."
296109,I chose it through an insurance broker near my house.
210250,I cut the cost of my auto insurance in half. Nationwide had extremely high increases every year in spite of the fact that I had no claims except the windshield crack in all of the years I had insurance with Nationwide - both auto and renters insurance.

187301,"I had State Farm a long time ago and they were very nice to me.  I had an excellent agent.  My sister and brother-in-law have State Farm, and I get a discount on my auto insurance because of them.  That is why I changed to State Farm.  I also love my new agent, Mary Ann Koval.  My girlfriend has her for her home and auto insurance and she loves Ms. Koval, too."

205561,"I have not been with them long enough to know how their service for claims and questions is like.  I also don't have a feel of how often and pervasive their policies change.  I am giving an 8 rating on the basis of Consumer Reports high ratings by customers, which I am expecting, if/when I need to file a claim.  The primary negative is the high premium."
250531,i have not had a claim..so i cannot rate
229964,I have not had any issues with them but I still feel rates are too high.

218120,I have only been insured with National General for 11 months.
210130,I have only been with them a few months. It is hard for me to say whether or not they are great.
295138,I have only had their coverage for a few months so I can't effectively communicate about the overall performance at this point
203275,"I have only had them for a month, so I have no opinion."
246823,I HAVE ONLY HAD THEM FOR TWO MONTHS SO I REALLY CAN'T SAY HOW GOOD THEY ARE

200505,I have researched this company and they are one of the best in the business.
244542,I have satisfied with my experiences with The Hartford.
250586,i have snapshot.. it's not going well
244909,I have to answer something to continue.  How dare you make me answer so many screening questions including some that were tricky and then have the unmitigated gall to tell me that this survey would take 25 more minutes to complete.  Bullshit is what that is and bullshit is what you're going to get!
199006,I have used them for yrs and never have any problems
248982,I have yet to have to file a claim so I do not know how smooth they would handle that process
215777,"I haven't been using Liberty Mutual long enough to have a great sense of their service, but they did offer me an identical product to other providers at a lower cost."
207457,I haven't been with them long enough to answer. so far they have been okay
227814,I haven't been with them long enough to garner a true opinion.

278104,I haven't had any experience in dealing with a claim with them.
203599,I havent had any issues in the short time I have been with them. They seem to be easy to contact if I have questions. The rate I got for my combined auto and renters insurance was very affordable.
216200,I haven't had any issues with them and everything is pretty easy to use on the site.
224608,"I haven't had any issues with them yet, and the price isn't too high"
214795,"I haven't had any issues with them yet, but I really haven't had them long enough to judge."

190345,I haven't had insurance with them long enough to form an opinion other than the price is lower
210311,I haven't had it very long.
256350,"I haven't had to make any claims yet, so I don't know how likely I'd be to recommend them."
188595,"I just barely switched.  I don't have an opinion of them, but my insurance broker spoke highly of them and the price was right."
195892,I just don't know how the insurance will be but the cost savings was too much to not try essurance!!
206559,I just got Nationwide as a unsure company. I dont know too much about this company yet

222632,"I just switched providers, the price is great but have not had to deal with them yet."
201758,I just switched to them from Liberty Mutual and I was able to lower my policy by $700 a year and get more coverage for my auto and renters insurance.
201821,I just switched to this company when I moved to a state that 21 Century does not insure.  GEICO was the cheapest option that provided the level of coverage that I wanted
241564,I keep them because of the cost.  Most of the time I don't speak to my agent - simply send the payment.
289566,I know a number of people who already had Farmers when I changed my insurance to them and know that everyone seems to be happy with them and their rates.
297812,i like
217362,"I like all in one credit union, credit card, investing and insurance"

I feel like I am getting good service for the money.  I feel like Nationwide will be there when I need them.  I also have perks like roadside assistance including a car rental included with my policy.

211635,"i never had any issues with farmers. brand familiarity, trust them, respect them"
244661,I never have a problem with this company and they have great recovery assistance.

205808,I saved a lot of money when I switched.
295941,I saved a significant amount of money switching to them.
295533,I saved over $1000 per year.
241798,"I so like what they have to offer, and, I have military family that may not be aware of them"
296387,I switched to Erie because I followed the agent from another company.
247801,I think it was an easy process
199567,I think many insurance companies are alike. I tend to go with the lowest premiums.
196106,I think overall they are a good company
216830,I think that they are pretty good from an insurance stand point.
259233,I think they are all about themselves not the customer
196172,I think they are reputable
214424,i THINK THEY DO A GOOD JOB.
186462,I think they have a fair price
260410,"I think Travelers is a very good insurance company.  Their customer service is wonderful.  They pay claims in a timely manner.   However, I did not rate 10 because I think their premiums are a bit high."
203859,I think Travelers is good enough for my friends/family since it is good enough for me.
191569,"I thought that the agent for CIG was very courteous...I just wish the cost of monthly insurance was cheaper!  I had the previous insurance, American Family, but it was too expensive."
212891,"I tried to find cheaper rates but could not. During my claim, I did not have to do anything, Nationwide took care of everything, including arranging for an auto rental. All I had to do was pick up my vehicle when it was ready and turn in my rental."
189810,i trust state farm and i feel confident in recommending my family/friends based on my positive experiences. their billing options are a bit archaic but basically they are the best insurance company and offer affordable prices.
280026,"I trust State Farm, but I haven't tested coverage by submitting a claim. They're also a bit pricey."
200234,i trust the process
188625,I trust them and have never had any trouble with them
203982,"I trust this company. Even though rates are getting higher, I still rather do business with them."
278700,"I use esurance, and the coverage is great for a great price."
189961,"I use Hartford as my auto carrier as I am a member of AARP and get discounted rates.  So far, Hartford as been reasonable with me regarding my rates.  I have never had to file a claim as of today"
200007,I used to work in the insurance industry for 45 years.  In that time I was most impressed with The Travelers.
197607,I usually don't recommend to a friend;  not that impressed with the local American Family office I deal with.
194300,I usually don't talk to other people about insurance.
196155,"I was able to get an umbrella of products, auto and homeowners policy coverage."
276884,I was given a really high rate even though many of my accidents are dropping off as well as my sr22
202149,I was given better information to make a smarter decision on my auto coverage needs.
264283,I was happy initially with the quote but they recently raised my premium for no reason
261320,"I was happy with southern california AAA, but find the northern CA version not up to par. They sold me a policy that did not include road side service and didn't tell me. When I needed roadside assistance, they wanted to charge me $50 just to look at the problem. I thought that was underhanded and devious. It was also dangerous because I have health problems and need roadside assistance, I have since obtained it from an independent company and will not renew AAA when my policy agreement is over."
214519,I was not happy how they handled our current personal injury claim and put false information in the claim report resulting in a rate increase.
193279,I was paying $2380 for 6 months at allstate. Progressive's rate was LESS than half! Like a little under $1000 for the exact same amount of coverage plus a roadside assitance plan
276966,I was pleased with their services.
287036,I WAS SATIFIED
222387,I would make it higher but I'm not happy with their rate increase.  They told me it was for everyone who lived in my state.
198065,I would neither recommend or not recommend them
193492,I would recommend Safeco because they have saved me lots of money.
274458,"id like to give them a 10 if that were possible. I went with AAA as a reputable company, but feel that I was taken advantage of by the agent who didn't give e the full details about what was needed to purchase an insurance policy. Like also having to purchase membership on top of he full year of insurance that I had paid for in full. Otherwise this company offers many other features that I hope to take advantage of in the near future for traveling purposes."
207081,I'm a new client so I don't have sufficient experience with them.
220433,I'm happy with their pricing and service.
199655,I'm happy with their rates and their service.
296814,I'm in my first year with this company and not had any claims experience
191557,I'm just not familiar enough with them yet to give any different
276583,I'm not in habit of making recommendations.
215572,"I'm not overly excited about them, but they had the best combined policy rate."
296826,"I'm not terribly familiar with it, but it's not too expensive"
297079,I'm over 50 and it allows an AARP discount
283139,impressed
277770,In August 2016 our car was hit from behind while on the interstate highway. Nationwide worked with the other party to get our car repairs paid for (the other party was at fault). Everything went fairly smoothly with our claim.

205952,"it is a second tier, high-risk insurer (founders). if anyone asks, i'll tell them what i've got."
196895,it is a very good company to work with and provide great coverag
280384,It is an insurer that offers excellent service
297503,"It is an ok insurance company.  One of the cheaper ones.  But the price has been creeping up every 6 months even with no claims being made and it doesn't seem that there are discounts for no claims or infractions on my driving record.  They have always been helpful whenever I've called about a policy question, but some of the time it is hard to understand them as they do ship their business overseas."

229323,it pay good
295357,"it seemed like a good company with competitive pricing, but I just switched so I don't have much more to back my decision"

270584,it was a good experience
204658,It was a little difficult getting things right on the policy

188767,I've experienced good customer service with them.
241424,"I've had a decent experience, but they did charge me strangely once. Instead of my usual direct withdrawl they sent a paper bill that i was unaware of because they sent it to the wrong address."
192276,I've had a good experience.
295133,I've had a VERY difficult time obtaining status updates and information from Safeco during my recent auto insurance claim.  Safeco has been TERRIBLE at customer service and communication during my claim.
186644,"I've had excellent experiences with their representatives and when my father (who is a broker in another state) asked what company I was using, he told me that Travelers was an excellent choice. I feel their rates are reasonable & have no complaints about anything in the 3 years that I've been using them.

283027,I've had them for years and they've offered great service at a great price.
251446,I've had them less than a year.

185887,"just like all other insurance companies....actuaries will continue to raise rates regardless of accident history.....once actuaries make rates too high, I'll search for another company.  Actuaries take long term loyal customers for granted hoping they'll ""just pay"" and not pay attention to continuous rate increased for no reason.  This is factored into their rate increases.  All insurance companies do this."

198979,MY AGENT IS GREAT
198541,"my agent is great, ive never had a problem with claims in all of my 18 years, i can never find a company with better rates"
203119,My agent seems sincere and helps me get the best rate I can.
246048,My agent was very friendly and helpful. The rates were lower than when I had with state auto. The cover was comparable. All in all it was an enjoyable experience.

222359,My experience with both their premiums and their customer service have been really good
201688,My experience with Hartford to this point in time is very limited
214117,"My former insurance provider's website would let you change things such as adding or removing a vehicle or changing coverage to current vehicles, and that information was updated and on the website within 10 minutes.  Nationwide takes a week for things to update online.  Also, my previous provider showed on my account online what my future payment amounts would be and when they'd be taken from my bank.  Nationwide does not offer this at all."
197020,my guy is very good once the company made a mistake that would have cost me much but he fixed it
235369,My husband and I are happy with the rates
263535,"My husband and I purchased a policy with AAA shortly after we got married, and their coverage options were far superior to what I had before. AAA is also more affordable than my previous insurance company."
290533,My husband and I recently married and therefore decided to find a new insurance policy between the two of us. By going with Erie Insurance it was actually less combined than what it was when we each had our own policies. We saved a lot of money!
213701,My husband has had a very good experience with them.
209792,My husband is a veteran.  He has been with USAA for many years.  They have been a great provider.  I have just recently switched my auto insurance to USAA.
234099,My local agent makes it so easy to change or buy the product.
189338,my opinion
276226,My parents had insurance with Farmers throughout my lifetime
193954,my parents use farmers and have never had a problem with them and since I have been using them I also have not had a problem
186237,"My particular agent is not good at all but I do have good coverage. I think I pay way too much for what I have, however, and believe I am being taken advantage of. When I totaled my car 2 years ago, I was given a great price for my vehicle and while there were some problems that I was faced with at Allstate during that time, overall the process was quick and painless."
283285,My previous experiences with them have been very positive.
188935,"My rate is very low, I have full coverage, and I can do everything very easily and quickly online."
196120,My relationship with my agent and the ease of access to him.
265789,My research determined that the AARP/Hartford insurance was the most economical choice.

198110,"Nationwide/Allied were reasonably priced and easy to deal with until I had a minor at fault accident in a rental car in January 2016.  This was the first at fault accident I had had in 55 years as a licensed driver.  Nationwide paid my claim of $2,000 less my $750 deductible which was okay, but then they proceeded to jack my rates up by over $100/month for the next 5 years.  I feel that based on my near perfect driving record with no tickets and only a scrape on a rental car in 55 years of driving, that this increase is excessive."

When he gave me my yearly quote I was stunned. I remember asking him to repeat because I could not believe what I heard, then when it came time to renew my plan for the year my rate WENT DOWN. How awesome is that? I did the plug-in thing they sent me to prove I did not do much driving like I explained to him and I even got a nice discount on renewal.

Originally went with AllState for one month until I could shop around.  Geico was an unknown but came in with the lowest rate....half of what AllState was charging for identical coverage so I went with them.  Have never had an auto claim so claim experience is an unknown...I will deal with that if it happens.  The cost was the primary reason for the rating."

They took care of EVERYTHING! Previously, we had everything with Armed Forces Insurance. After 10 years of paying premiums on time, we had to file a claim for a roof leak that involved two third parties - our HOA and their Roofer. They were painfully reluctant to step in for months until I filed a complaint with the Department of Insurance."
